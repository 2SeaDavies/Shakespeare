"[Verse 1]  
I know that I've messed up  
You never let me give up  
All the nights and the fights  
And the blood and the breakups  
You're always there to call up  
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid  
But yeah, you understand  
Yeah like no one can  
I know that we don't look like much  
But no one fucks it up like us  
  
[Verse 2]  
Sixteen and you never even judged me  
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me  
Sitting there in the caravan  
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor  
And yeah you understand  
Yeah like no one can  
We both know what they say about us  
But they don't stand a chance because  
  
[Chorus]  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
I'm standing with an army  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
  
[Verse 3]  
Dark times, you can always find the bright side  
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice  
Just to be there for me  
How you cringe when you sing out of tune  
And yeah it's everything  
So don't change a thing  
We both know what they say about us  
But they don't stand a chance because  
  
[Chorus]  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
I'm standing with an army  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
  
[Refrain]  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
(I'll be yours)  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
I'm standing with an army  
  
[Bridge]  
Yeah you understand  
Yeah like no one can  
We both know what they say about us  
  
[Chorus]  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
I'm standing with an army  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
They don't have a chance either  
  
[Outro]  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing near you  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
When I'm with you  
Standing with an army

"Eyes make their peace in difficulties with wounded lips and salted cheeks.  
And finally we step to leave to the departure lounge of disbelief.  
  
And I don't know where I'm going but I know it's gonna be a long time.  
And I'll be leaving in the morning come to the white wine bitter sunlight.  
  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight  
Before the bleeding sun comes alive  
I want to make the best of what is left hold tight  
And hear my beating heart one last time before daylight.  
  
And the canyon underneath the trees  
Behind the dark sky you looked at me.  
I fell for you like autumn leaves  
Never faded evergreen  
  
And I don't know where I'm going but I know it's gonna be a long time  
'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning come to the white wine bitter sunlight  
  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight  
Before the bleeding sun comes alive  
I want to make the best of what is left hold tight  
And hear my beating heart one last time.  
  
I can't face, now everything has changed  
I just wanna be by your side  
Here's hoping we collide  
Here's hoping we collide  
Here's hoping we collide  
  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight  
Before the bleeding sun comes alive  
I wanna make the best of what is left hold tight  
And hear my beating heart one last time  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight.

"Your arms around me come undone  
Makes my heart beat like a drum  
See the panic in my eyes  
Kiss me only when you cry  
'Cause you always want what you're running from  
And you know this is more than you can take  
  
Baby don't forget my name  
When the morning breaks us  
Baby please don't look away  
When the morning breaks us  
Oh your touch, so bittersweet  
Baby don't forget my name  
When the morning breaks us  
  
Your cheek is softly by the sun  
Makes my heart beat like a drum  
I know it hurts you, I know it burns you  
Hot and cold in a lonely hotel room  
Look into me, tell me why you're crying I need to know  
'Cause you always want what you're running from  
It's always been away  
  
Baby don't forget my name  
When the morning breaks us  
Baby please don't look away  
When the morning breaks us  
Oh your touch, so bittersweet  
Baby don't forget my name  
When the morning breaks us  
  
'Cause you always want what you're running from  
  
Baby don't forget my name  
When the morning breaks us  
Baby please don't look away  
When the morning breaks us  
Oh your touch, so bittersweet  
Baby don't forget my name  
When the morning breaks us

"If I was not myself  
And you were someone else  
I'd say so much to you  
And I would tell the truth  
It's high, can't hardly breathe  
  
When your hands let go of me  
The eyes say standing out  
And I feel things from selves  
  
I'm dead in the water  
Still looking for ya  
I'm dead in the water  
Can't you see, can't you see  
  
You've seen this all before  
Life left on the shore  
We're smiling all the same  
You sail away again  
  
I'm dead in the water  
Still looking for ya  
I'm dead in the water  
Can't you see, can't you see  
  
Oh yeah  
I'm dead in the water  
Still looking for ya  
I'm dead in the water  
Can't you see, can't you see  
  
I'm dead in the water  
Still looking for ya  
I'm dead in the water

"Stones falling down  
Rollercoaster, heart pound?  
Fears overplayed...  
Two left feet emergency.  
  
Wide open space  
Catch my tail,  
Fishing net.  
Fold up my frown  
Take the rage  
And smooth it out.  
  
Stick to my skin,  
Paper mache face to live in.  
Same view to paint,  
Watercolour your name  
  
Face your mistakes

Oil your chains, under rate.  
(You will never have to feel that way again)

We've got our guns and horses  
I know you've been burned  
But every fire is a lesson learned  
  
I left my house  
Left my clothes  
Door wide open, heaven knows  
You're so worth it  
You are

I'd do it all for you, I would  
I would, I would, I would

'Cause they amount to nothing  
Play it down  
Pretend you can't take what you found  
But you found me  
On a screen you sit at permanently

I would, I would, I would  
  
It's time to come clean,  
And make sense of everything  
It's time that we found out who we are  
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark  
I see your face in every star  
  
But I wish I could feel it all for you  
I wish I could be it all for you  
If I could erase the pain

But you never fought for me  
When I was a shelter  
'Cause you're not heading home to me

We could be closer  
We could be

You show me what it feels like to be lost

When we're alone, it could be home

Because my mind is on you

And piece it together  
Watch the blood from both my hands  
I can't see the ending  
There are people who know my every secret  
I'm tired of pretending  
You read my heart  
You read my heart  
  
Are we star crossed lovers?  
Did I really want you gone?  
If I'm really a winner  
Where do these demons come from?

"[Verse 1]  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and ever pining  
Til He appeared and the spirit felt its worth  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O the night when Christ was born  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
  
[Verse 2]  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains He shall break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
O the world, the star is sweetly gleaming  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we

Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O the night when Christ was born  
O night divine

"We've only ever kissed lying down  
We've only ever touched  
When there's no one else around  
I can be elusive  
If you want me to  
I'm not being intrusive  
I just wish I knew the truth  
  
As to why  
I wait for you  
Longer than the average person would  
And why  
I think about you  
More than I think one should  
  
Our bodies fit together  
Like a make-shift puzzle  
And it's clear to see why you puzzle me  
And you turn your frame  
And you whisper my name  
As though I am a burden  
  
Cause I'm making up for lost time  
And I'm making up for you  
And I'm waking up from last night  
And I'm waking up with you  
So what's new?  
So what's new?  
  
I am at your house  
So I belong to you for now  
Trying to impress you  
But lord I don't know how  
I can be a statue  
If you want me to  
I'm not being difficult  
I just need to know the truth  
  
As to why  
I'm wanting you  
And I would take you if I could  
And why I'm still (lay?) here  
It's something I still haven't understood  
  
Our hands rest together  
Like pieces of paper  
But they're always blank  
When I hold your hand  
And it gave you a fright  
When I stayed the night  
And you gave yourself to me  
  
Cause I'm making up for lost time  
And I'm making up for you  
And I'm waking up from last night  
And I'm waking up with you  
So what's new?  
So what's new?  
  
It's not the end  
It's not the end  
So don't lets pretend  
  
Cause I'm making up for lost time  
And I'm making up for you  
And I'm waking up from last night  
And I'm making up for you  
So what's new?  
So what's new?  
So what's new?

Solace my game  
It stars you.  
  
Swing wide your crane,  
Swing wide your crane  
And run me through.  
  
And the story's all over you  
In the morning I'll call you  
Can't you find a clue when  
Your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue.  
  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
Don't bother me.  
What might have been lost  
Don't bother me  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
  
Someday my pain  
Someday my pain  
Someday my pain  
Someday my pain.

"You wait for a silence  
I wait for a word  
Lie next to your frame  
Girl unobserved  
You change your position  
And you are changing me  
Casting these shadows  
Where they shouldn't be  
  
We're interrupted by the heat of the sun  
Trying to prevent what's already begun  
You're just a body  
I can smell your skin  
And when I feel it, you're wearing thin  
  
But I've got a plan  
Why don't you be the artist,  
And make me out of clay?  
Why don't you be the writer  
And decide the words I say?  
'Cause I'd rather pretend  
I'll still be there at the end  
Only it's too hard to ask,  
Won't you try to help me  
  
Sat on your sofa, it's all broken springs  
This isn't the place for those violin strings  
I try out a smile and I aim it at you  
You must have missed it  
You always do  
  
But I've got a plan  
Why don't you be the artist,  
And make me out of clay?  
Why don't you be the writer  
And decide the words I say?  
'Cause I'd rather pretend  
I'll still be there at the end  
Only it's too hard to ask,  
Won't you try to help me  
  
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted  
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted  
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted  
You wait, I wait, casting shadows  
  
Why don't you be the artist,  
And make me out of clay?  
Why don't you be the writer  
And decide the words I say?  
'Cause I'd rather pretend  
I'll still be there at the end  
Only it's too hard to ask,  
Won't you try to help me  
  
Why don't you be the artist,  
And make me out of clay?  
Why don't you be the writer  
And decide the words I say?  
'Cause I'd rather pretend  
I'll still be there at the end  
Only it's too hard to ask,  
Won't you try to help me

"Who are we to be emotional?  
Who are we to play with hearts and throw away it all?  
Oh, who are we to turn eachother's heads?  
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds?  
  
Oh, I don't like the way I never listen to myself  
I feel like I'm on fire and I'm trying to cry for help  
Oh, I don't think you know me much at all  
  
This love is be and end all  
This love will be your downfall  
This love is be and end all  
This love will be your downfall  
  
I'm feeling down about this love  
  
Who are you to make me feel so good?  
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood?  
Oh, who am I to say I'm always yours?  
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores?  
Oh, I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart  
We're falling on each other like we're always in the dark  
Oh, I don't think you know me much at all, at all  
  
This love is be and end all  
This love will be your downfall  
This love is be and end all  
This love will be your downfall  
This love is be and end all  
This love will be your downfall  
(At all)  
  
This love is not what you want  
This heart will never be yours  
This love is be and end all  
This love will be your downfall  
This love is be and end all  
This love will be your downfall

"[Verse 1]  
Reaching higher than towers  
Wasn't anywhere we couldn't went  
We had unbreakable powers  
When our bodies meet, it's everything  
This is was a beautiful vision  
Even love was not a way you could describe it  
And then there comes a collision  
Nothing ever goes in the night  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And they're not lost forever  
Lost what once was here  
It's now just spots  
Now the fireworks are fading  
Is it over?  
Lost you in the summer two years ago  
  
[Chorus]  
You, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
Two years ago  
You, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
Two years ago  
  
[Verse 2]  
If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck?  
Thought our love is insurmountable  
He knows my heart is still aching  
Never thought it would be caused by you  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
We're not lost forever  
Lost what once was here  
It's now just spots  
Now the fireworks are fading  
Is it over?  
Lost you in the summer two years ago  
  
[Chorus]  
You, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
Two years ago  
You, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
Two years ago  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Two years ago  
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong  
Two years ago  
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Moving on, moving on, moving on  
  
[Bridge]  
And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too  
I know you think of me, too  
I'll use this moment to really forget  
I will soon, but for now  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Two years ago  
About you, about you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
Two years ago  
About you, about you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
Two years ago  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Two years ago  
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong  
Two years ago  
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Moving on, moving on, moving on  
Two years ago  
  
[Outro]  
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong  
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Moving on, moving on, moving on

"[Verse 1]  
Let's call it a day, babe  
I think I know what you're trying to say  
Honey, it's fair play  
Why try to win when I know I've lost?  
We don't have to spell it  
I think I know what you're trying to say  
Just because I think this could break me  
It doesn't mean that it will at all  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Love to the lovers  
Hate to the haters  
Love to you, babe  
Do what you have to  
  
[Chorus]  
What a shame  
What a loss  
The winner takes  
She takes it all  
What a shame  
What a loss  
But I can see why  
Because she's beautiful  
What a defeat  
To say the least  
But thank God  
The love is free  
And maybe it's good for you  
It's good for me  
  
[Verse 2]  
Let's call it a day, babe  
I think I know what you're trying to say  
And honey you're so right  
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn  
Let's call it a maybe  
But we both know you're already gone  
And just because it feels like I'm breaking  
It doesn't mean I will fall apart  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Love to the lovers  
Hate to the haters  
Love to you, babe  
Do what you have to

What a shame  
What a loss  
The winner takes  
She takes it all  
What a shame  
What a loss  
But I can see why  
Because she's beautiful  
What a defeat  
To say the least  
But thank God  
The love is free  
And maybe it's good for you  
It's good for me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Love to you, babe  
Love to the lovers  
Hate to the haters  
Love to you, babe  
Do what you have to  
  
[Chorus]  
What a shame  
What a loss  
The winner takes  
She takes it all  
What a shame  
What a loss  
But I can see why  
Because she's beautiful  
What a defeat  
To say the least  
But thank God  
The love is free  
And maybe it's good for you  
It's good for me

"Why can't we speak another language  
One we all agree on  
When men look outside, they see houses  
Instead of the fields they grew from  
We are constantly uprooted from them  
Making us tiresome (and fearful)  
Can you get up right now  
Endeavor to free fall?  
  
You can fall if you want to!  
It's just a matter of how far  
You've treasured our hometown,  
But you've forgotten where you are  
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found,  
And it has been found wondering around  
  
With that skipping rope, the trampoline,  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didn't give up hope  
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed  
  
Patterns all arranged in my background  
Pillars and posts keeping this country on form  
Letters were all sent  
With no addresses so that people can't discover  
That we're always under cover  
Why do I always draw triangles?  
Instead of words this paper deserves  
  
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind,  
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find  
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind,  
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find  
  
With that skipping rope, the trampoline,  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didn't give up hope  
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed  
  
You can fall if you want to!  
It's just a matter of how far  
You've treasured our hometown,  
But you've forgotten where you are  
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found,  
And it has been found wondering around  
  
With that skipping rope, the trampoline,  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didn't give up hope  
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed

"(You, my everything)  
(You, my everything)  
  
You are my only hope  
The truth that dealt the consequence  
I know you don't feel the same  
You're sensible but it doesn't make sense  
I know I'm gonna weep my heart out  
You know I'm gonna try much harder  
But it isn't the shit in my head  
Pulling me under this time  
  
Could have given me something  
You my everything  
You left me kneeling  
I was one of those people  
You, my everything  
You, my everything  
You, my everything  
  
You were my backbone when  
The truth that dealt the consequence  
You were my hometown when  
My heart was filled with loneliness  
Just as the dark was rising  
You know I'm gonna try much harder  
But it isn't the shit in my head  
Pulling me under this time  
  
Could have given me something  
You my everything  
You left me kneeling  
I was one of those people  
You, my everything  
You, my everything  
You, my everything  
  
Could have given me something  
You my everything  
You left me kneeling  
(You my everything)  
I was one of those people  
You, my everything  
  
For what it's worth  
For what it's worth  
For what it's worth  
  
You were my backbone when  
My body ached with wearyness  
You were my hometown when  
My heart was filled with loneliness  
Just as the dark was rising  
I heard you close the door again  
Just as the light turns out  
I know who I dream of

"
"Take cover  
Signs don't show  
You drove me  
Off the road  
  
But you let go  
'Cause your hope is gone  
And every question fades away  
  
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from  
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off  
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start?  
  
You know this is your biggest mistake  
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste  
And of all the things you never explained  
Well you know this is your biggest mistake  
  
You tread water  
Fighting for the air in your lungs  
Move  
Move closer  
Maybe you can right all your wrongs  
  
But you let go  
'Cause your hope is gone  
And every answer fades away  
  
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from  
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off  
Would it take the end of time to hear your hearts false start?  
  
You know this is your biggest mistake  
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste  
And of all the things you never explained  
Well you know this is your biggest mistake  
  
Wipe the mud spray from the face stop the engine  
Stop pretending  
Wipe the mud spray from your face stop the engine,  
Stop pretending, that you're still breathing  
  
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from  
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off  
Would it take the end of time to hear your hearts false start?  
  
You know this is your biggest mistake  
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste  
And of all the things you never explained  
Well you know this is your biggest mistake  
  
You know this is your biggest mistake  
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste  
And of all the things you never explained  
Well you know this is your biggest mistake

"It's a little bit funny  
This feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can  
Easily hide  
  
I don't have much money  
But boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where  
We both could live.  
  
So excuse me forgetting  
But these things I do  
See I've forgotten if  
They're green or they're blue  
  
Anyway the thing is,  
What I really mean,  
Yours are the sweetest eyes  
I've ever seen  
  
And you can tell everybody  
This is your song  
It maybe quite simple but  
Now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind  
That I put down in words  
How wonderful life is  
Now you're in the world  
  
If I was a sculptor  
But then again no  
Or a girl who makes potions in  
A traveling show  
I know it's not much but  
It's the best I can do.  
My gift is my song and  
This one's for you.  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And you can tell everybody  
This is your song  
It may be quite simple but  
Now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind  
That I put down in words  
How wonderful life is  
Now you're in the world.
