I don't know how many you people believe in astrology  
Yeah, that's right, that's right, baby, I, I am a  
Sagittarius  
The most philosophical of all the signs  
But anyway, I don't believe in it  
I think it's a bunch of bullshit, myself  
But I tell you this, man, I tell you this  
I don't know what's gonna happen, man,  
But I want to have my kicks  
Before the whole shithouse goes up in flames  
Alright!

"Angels and sailors  
Rich girls  
Backyard fences  
Tents  
Dreams watching each other narrowly  
Soft luxuriant cars  
Girls in garages, stripped  
Out to get liquor and clothes  
Half gallons of wine and six-packs of beer  
Jumped, humped, born to suffer  
Made to undress in the wilderness.  
I will never treat you mean  
Never start no kind of scene  
I'll tell you every place and person that I've been.  
Always a playground instructor, never a killer  
Always a bridesmaid on the verge of fame or over  
He maneuvered two girls into his hotel room  
One a friend, the other, the young one, a newer stranger  
Vaguely Mexican or Puerto Rican  
Poor boys thighs and buttock scarred by a father's belt  
She's trying to rise  
Story of her boyfriend, of teenage stoned death games  
Handsome lad, dead in a car  
Confusion  
No connections  
Come 'ere  
I love you  
Peace on earth  
Will you die for me?  
Eat me  
This way  
The end  
I'll always be true  
Never go out, sneaking out on you, babe  
If you'll only show me Far Arden again.  
I'm surprised you could get it up  
He whips her lightly, sardonically, with belt  
Haven't I been through enough? she asks  
Now dressed and leaving  
The Spanish girl begins to bleed  
She says her period  
It's Catholic heaven  
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck  
My chest is hard and brown  
Lying on stained, wretched sheets with a bleeding virgin  
We could plan a murder  
Or start a religion.

"Who scared you? Why were you born, my babe?  
In two-time's arms with all of your charms, my love.  
Why were you born? Just to play with me?  
To freak out or to be beautiful, my dear?  
Load your head, blow it up, feeling good, baby  
Load your head, blow it up, feeling good, baby, ahh.  
Well my room is so cold, you know you don't have to go, my babe.  
And if you warm it up right, I'm gonna love you tonight, my love.  
Well I'm glad that we came, I hope you're feeling the same.  
Who scared you and why were you born? Please stay.  
I see your rider, coming down the road.  
Got a burden, carrying a heavy load,  
One sack of silver and one bag of gold.

"All right,  
Wild child full of grace  
Savior of the human race,  
Your cool face  
Natural child, terrible child  
Not your mother's or your father's child  
Your our child, screamin' wild  
An ancient rulage of grains,  
And the trees of the night  
Ha, ha, ha, ha  
With hunger at her heels,  
Freedom in her eyes  
She dances on her knees,  
Pirate prince at her side  
Stirrin' into a hollow idols eyes  
Wild child full of grace,  
Savior of the human race  
Your cool face,  
Your cool face,  
Your cool face  
Do you remember when we were in Africa?

"Wintertime winds blow cold the season  
Fallen in love, I'm hopin' to be  
Wind is so cold, is that the reason?  
Keeping you warm, your hands touching me  
Come with me dance, my dear  
Winter's so cold this year  
You are so warm  
My wintertime love to be  
Winter time winds blue and freezin'  
Comin' from northern storms in the sea  
Love has been lost, is that the reason?  
Trying so desperately to be free  
Come with me dance, my dear  
Winter's so cold this year  
And you are so warm  
My wintertime love to be  
La, la, la, la  
Come with me dance, my dear  
Winter's so cold this year  
You are so warm  
My wintertime love to be

"Wishful crystal  
Water covers everything in blue  
Coolin' water  
Wishful sinful  
Our love is beautiful to see  
I know where I would like to be  
Right back where I came  
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue  
Water covers you  
Wishful, sinful, wicked you  
Can't escape the blue  
Magic risin'  
Sun is shinin' deep beneath the sea  
But not enough for you and me and sunshine  
Love to hear the wind cry  
Wishful sinful  
Our love is beautiful to see  
I know where I would like to be  
Right back where I came  
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue  
Water covers you  
Wishful, sinful, wicked you  
Can't escape the blue  
Love to hear the wind cry  
Love to hear you cry, yeah, yeah
