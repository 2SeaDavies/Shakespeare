"There goes the siren that warns of the air raid  
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak  
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne  
Got to get up for the coming attack.  
  
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines  
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste  
Gathering speed as we head down the runway  
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.  
  
Running, scrambling, flying  
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again.  
Running, scrambling, flying  
Rolling, turning, diving.  
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die  
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces high.  
  
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers  
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away  
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them  
Move to their blindsides and firing again.  
  
Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us  
Ten ME-109's out of the sun  
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them  
Heading straight for them I press down my guns  
  
Rolling, turning, diving  
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again  
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die  
Run, live to fly, fly to live,  
Aces high.

"I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more  
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart  
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause  
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all  
  
And all the politicians and their hollow promises  
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it  
The working man pays everything for their mistakes  
And with his life too if there was to be a war  
  
[Chorus]  
So we can only get one chance, can we take it?  
And we only got one life, can't exchange it  
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it  
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream  
  
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday  
The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday  
Assailants know just how much further they can go  
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can't protect yourselves even in your own home  
For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes  
So now the criminal they launch right in our face  
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace  
  
Despondent public worries, where it will all end?  
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend  
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst  
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just  
  
[Chorus]

"'What the fuck is that?'  
'Hi, guys, are you in a band or something?  
I mean it would be so cool  
If you were in a band 'cause you're  
Driving a big bus with band on the front of it'  
'Why don't you shut up and get on board will ya?'  
'Wow! I have it here you got a stereo and a microwave  
And, and you got a beer,  
I'd like a Heineken if you've got one'  
That's real cool, that's great, yeah!'  
'Would you like to see Black Bart?'  
'Who's Black Bart?'  
'Let me introduce you'  
  
Black Bart's seen it  
Black Bart knows  
Black Bart's done it  
The Black Bart blues  
Suspended in suspension  
Medieval nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems  
Black Bart's lookin'  
Don't know where she's been  
Maybe she's an acrobat  
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart tried most anything  
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing  
So he asked me to tell ya  
Try it for yourself and you will see  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
'What did you do that for?'  
'I'm sorry, I just, I guess I'm not used to...  
'Shut up and get on with it will you'  
  
Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now  
Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow  
So if you are a dancer,  
You could dance his pole in May  
That's a maypole  
  
Black Bart's coming  
Now Black Bart's gone  
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song  
Whatever and however,  
In and out or several at a time mmm yes!  
We all got to do the Black Bart blues  
Here comes the guitar solo  
  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!

"And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life  
What do you think you'd expect you would see?  
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life  
And in the river reflections of me  
  
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see  
And in a movement he beckons to me  
And in a moment the memories are all that remain  
And all the wounds are reopening again  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
And as you look all around at the world in dismay  
What do you see, do you think we have learned  
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray  
Out in the streets where the babies are burned  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world  
There are times I'm ashamed of us all  
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel  
And reflecting the good and the bad  
  
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?  
Can you really tell me what life is?  
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you  
Could be swept away by fate's own hand  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
When you think that we've used all our chances  
And the chance to make everything right  
Keep on making the same old mistakes  
Makes untipping the balance so easy  
When we're living our lives on the edge  
Say a prayer on the book of the dead  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life

"Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here  
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear  
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone  
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home  
  
Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all  
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall  
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell  
All is lost sold your souls to this brave new world  
  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
  
Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now  
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh  
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth  
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world  
  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world

"We are not the sons of God  
We are not his chosen people now  
We have crossed the path he trod  
We will feel the pain of his beginning  
  
Shadow fingers rise above  
Iron fingers stab the desert sky  
Oh behold the power of the Earth.  
Are your children ready for the fall?  
  
Locking hands together well  
Raze a city, build a living hell  
Join the race to suicide  
Listen for the tolling of the bell  
  
Out of the the universe, a strange light is born  
Unholy union, trinity reformed  
  
Yellow sun it's evil twin  
in the black the winds deliver him  
We will sleep to souls within  
At a siege a nuclear gust is riven  
  
Out of the the universe, a strange light is born  
Unholy union, trinity reformed  
  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns

Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns

Burying our head in the sand  
E equals MC squared, you can't relate  
How we made God with our hands  
  
Whatever would Robert have said to his God  
About he made war with the Sun  
E equals MC squared, you can't relate  
How we made God with our hands  
  
All nations are rising  
Through acid bells of love and hate  
Chain medals of Satan  
Uncertainty led us all to this  
  
All nations are raising  
Through acid bells of love and hate  
Confusion and Fury  
  
This body carried em' down in vain  
I was preaching of a small pray  
In the bunker where we'll die  
We're the executioners that lie  
  
Bombers launched with no recall  
Minute warning of the missile fall  
Take a look at your last day  
Guessing you won't have the time to cry  
  
Out of the the universe, a strange light was born  
Unholy union, trinity reformed  
  
Out of the darkness  
Out of the darkness  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns

"When I stand before you shining  
In the early morning sun  
When I feel the engines roar  
And I thing of what we've done  
  
Oh, the bittersweet reflection as  
We kiss the earth goodbye  
As the waves and echos of the  
Towns became the ghost of time  
  
Over borders that divide the  
Earthbound tribes  
No greed and no religion  
Just a hungred winged souls  
  
We will ride this thunderbird  
Silver shadows on the earth  
A thousand leagues away  
Our land of birth  
  
To albions land  
Coming home  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
Carving on the edge of daylight  
Till it slips into the void  
Waited in the long night dreaming  
Till the sun is born again  
  
Stretch the fingers of my hand  
Cover countries with my span  
Just a lonely satellite  
Speck of dust and cosmic sand  
  
Over borders that divide the  
Earthbound tribes  
Through the dark atlantic  
Over mariners stormy waves  
  
We will ride this thunderbird  
Silver shadows on the earth  
A thousand leagues away  
Our land of birth  
  
To albions land  
Coming home  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
To albions land  
Coming home  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
Coming home, far away  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn

"Who would be a poor man, a beggar man, a thief  
If he had a rich man in his hand  
And who would steal the candy from a laughing baby's mouth  
If he could take it from the money man  
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again  
She signs no contract but she always plays it clean  
She dines in Hampstead village, an expense accounted gruel  
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school  
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys  
Would rather make it with a letching gray  
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung  
Who watches through the railings as they play  
Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along  
A poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song  
A rich man's stealer but her favour's good and strong  
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate, let the poor man get along  
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys  
Would rather make it with a letching gray  
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung  
Who watches through the railings as they play  
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again  
She signs no contracts but she always plays it clean  
She dines in Hampstead village, an expense accounted gruel  
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school  
Cross-eyed Mary, oh Mary, oh cross-eyed mary

"Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how?  
A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really
happening?  
  
Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place?  
Something vivid comes again into my mind  
And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place  
Something vivid comes again into my mind  
  
All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation  
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more  
  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
  
Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before  
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind  
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality  
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind  
  
All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation  
Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself  
  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
  
I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night  
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again  
Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare  
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head  
  
Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring  
Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
  
Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox  
Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace  
Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place  
Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
The dream is true, the dream is true

"Everybody's waiting for something to happen  
Everybody's waiting for something to see  
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters  
Everyone's waiting for news on TV  
  
Winding lives at the end of the spiral  
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill  
Everyone's looking, but no one is listening  
Everybody wants to be in at the kill  
  
I wait for the signs, they tell me true  
I see the signs of the end of time  
  
Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing  
Everyone's looking for the reason why  
Everyone's hoping for life everafter  
Everyone's looking at death from the sky  
  
Everyone's nightmares are going to happen  
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes  
Everyone's praying but no one's believing  
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies  
  
I wait for the signs, they tell me true  
I see the signs of the end

So I watch and I wait  
And I pray for an awnser  
An end to the strife and the world's misery  
But the end never came  
And we're digging the graves  
And we're loading the guns for the kill  
  
Can the end be at hand?  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy?  
Can the end be at hand?  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can the end be at hand?  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy?  
Can the end be at hand?  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy?

"I am a man who walks alone  
And when I'm walking a dark road  
At night or strolling through the park  
  
When the light begins to fade  
I sometimes feel a little strange  
A little anxious when it's dark  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there  
  
Have you run your fingers down  
The wall  
And have you felt your neck skin crawl  
When you're searching for the light?  
Sometimes when you're scared  
To take a look  
At the corner of the room  
You've sensed that something's  
Watching you  
  
Have you ever been alone at night  
Thought you heard footsteps behind  
And turned around and no one's there?  
And as you quicken up your pace  
You find it hard to look again  
Because you're sure there's  
Someone there  
  
Watching horror films the night before  
Debating witches and folklore's  
The unknown troubles on your mind  
Maybe your mind is playing tricks  
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix  
On dancing shadows from behind  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there  
  
When I'm walking a dark road  
I am a man who walks alone

"As a young boy chasing dragons with your wooden sword so mighty,  
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.  
Times change very quickly,  
and you had to grow up early,  
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll die as you lived  
In a flash of the blade,  
In a corner forgotten by no one.  
You lived for the touch  
For the feel of the steel  
One man, and his honor.  
  
The smell of resigned leather  
The steely iron mask  
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.  
He taught you all he knew  
To fear no mortal man  
and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the  
Screams of evil men.

"As the sun breaks, above the ground,  
An old man stands on the hill,  
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light  
A birdsong shatters the still.  
  
His eyes are ablaze,  
See the madman in his gaze.  
  
Fly, on your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun,  
On your way, like an eagle,  
Fly and touch the sun.  
  
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears  
Looks the old man in the eye  
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd  
In the name of God my father I fly.  
  
His eyes seem so glazed  
As he flies on the wings of a dream,  
Now he knows his father betrayed  
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave.  
  
Fly, on your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun,  
  
On your way, like an eagle,  
Fly and touch the sun.  
  
YEAH!  
  
Fly, on your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun,  
On your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun.  
  
On your way, like an eagle,  
Fly, touch the sun.  
  
On your way, like a... eagle,

"Are you a man of peace  
Or a man of holy war  
Too many sides to you  
Don't know which anymore  
So many full of life  
But also filled with pain  
Don't know just how many  
Will live to breathe again  
  
A life that's made to breathe  
Destruction or defense  
A mind that's vain corruption  
Bad or good intent  
A wolf in sheep's clothing  
Or saintly or sinner  
Or some that would believe  
A holy war winner  
  
They fire off many shots  
And many parting blows  
Their actions beyond a reasoning  
Only God would know  
And as he lies in heaven  
Or it could be in hell  
I feel he's somewhere here  
Or looking from below  
But I don't know, I don't know

Please tell me now what life is  
Please tell me now what love is  
Well tell me now what war is  
Again tell me what life is  
  
More pain and misery in the history of mankind  
Sometimes it seems more like  
The blind leading the blind  
It brings upon us more famine, death and war  
You know religion has a lot to answer for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And as they search to find the bodies in the sand  
They find its ashes that are  
Scattered across the land  
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind  
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins  
  
And all because of it you'd think  
That we would learn  
But still the body count the city fires burn  
Somewhere there's someone dying  
In a foreign land  
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man  
Tell me why, tell me why  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
For the greater good of God (x8)  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
For the greater good of God (x8)  
  
He gave his life for us  
He fell upon the cross  
To die for all of those  
Who never mourn his loss  
It wasn't meant for us  
To feel the pain again  
Tell me why, tell me why

"After the war  
And now that they've sent us homeward  
I can't help but feel that I'm on my own  
No one can see just what this conflict has done to  
The minds of the men who are on their way home  
  
I'm scarred for life  
But it's not my flesh that's wounded  
So how can I face the torment alone  
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares  
I lay there and sweat until it gets light  
  
People say 'don't worry'  
Say that time's a perfect healer  
That the nightmares they will come to pass  
Can't hear what they're saying  
I am living in my own world  
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time  
  
I hear voices in my head  
Could I really be going crazy  
In the night the visions seem so real  
Do you care if you live or die  
When you laugh are you really crying  
You're not sure what's real anymore  
  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
No pain anymore  
  
Sometimes I wake  
I feel that my spirit's broken  
I wonder if I've the strength  
Carry on carry on

"She fell in love with his greasy machine  
She leaned over wiped his head  
Kick start clean  
She'd never seen the beast before  
But she left there wanting  
More more more  
But when she was walking on  
Down the road  
She heard a sound that made  
Her heart explode  
He whispered to her to get on the back  
""I'll take you on a ride  
From here to eternity""  
  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity

Crazy dreams  
She'd never sat on a piece so mean  
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine  
She even thought she heard the  
Engine sigh  
  
But like all dreams that come to an end  
They took a tumble at the devil's bend  
The beast and Charlotte they were  
Two of a kind  
They'd always take the line  
From here to eternity

I feel them closing in  
I've got to say that I'm scared  
I know they'll win  
Even so, I'm prepared  
  
Do you believe, what you hear  
Can you believe, what you see  
Do you believe, what you feel  
Can you believe  
  
What is real?  
Futureal  
What is real?  
Futureal  
  
Whenever anyone seems  
To treat me like a freak  
It makes me see I'm the  
Only one who feels  
That I know what is real  
  
Sometimes it feels like a game  
Of deadly hide and seek  
And when you're reading this  
Then I'll be gone  
Maybe then, you will see

"Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave  
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved  
You pray for daylight to save you for a while  
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile  
  
Dead men, tell no tales  
Gangland, murder's up for sale  
Dead men, tell no tales  
Gangland, where jail birds die  
  
Face at the window leers into your own  
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones  
How long can you hide? How long till they come?  
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive  
  
Once you were glad to be free for a while  
The air tasted good and the world was your friend  
Then came the day when the hard times began  
Now you're alone, but alive for how long?  
  
A knife at your throat another body on the pile  
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile  
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain  
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail  
  
Dead men, tell no tales  
In Gangland, murder's up for sale  
Dead men, tell no tales  
In Gangland, where jail birds die  
  
In Gangland you tell no tales

"Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul  
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal  
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight  
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights  
  
To the women and children, the souls of the dead  
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed  
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap  
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek  
  
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame  
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself  
You can't blame a madman if you go insane  
Give me the strength so I carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
  
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame  
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself  
You can't blame a madman if you go insane  
Give me the strength so I carry on

"I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey  
On the bow I stand, west is where I go  
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray  
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray  
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun  
But I know, but I know, but I know  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,  
Chasing rainbows all my days  
  
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been  
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,  
Nothing's real until you feel  
  
I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name  
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain  
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind  
For eternity I follow on there is no other way  
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun  
But I know, I know  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son  
Chasing rainbows all my days  
  
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been

"I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime  
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time  
Cause at 5 o'clock, they take me to the Gallows Pole  
The sands of time for me are running low, yeah!  
  
When the priest comes to read me the last rites  
I take a look through the bars at the last sights  
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me  
  
Can it be that there's some sort of error  
Hard to stop the surmounting terror  
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?  
  
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming  
It's not easy to stop from screaming  
The words escape me when I try to speak  
Tears flow, but why am I crying  
After all I'm not afraid of dying  
Don't I believe that there never is an end  
  
As the guards march me out to the courtyard  
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""  
If there's a God then why has he let me go?  
  
As I walk my life drifts before me  
Though the end is near I'm not sorry  
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away  
  
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on  
Don't worry now that I have gone  
I've gone beyond to seek the truth  
  
When you know that your time is close at hand  
Maybe then you'll begin to understand  
Life down here is just a strange illusion.  
Yeah hallowed be thy name  
Yeah hallowed by thy name  
Yeah

"Can't understand what is happening to me,  
This isn't real, this is only a dream,  
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before,  
I'm looking down on my body below,  
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,  
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?  
I can't believe that really my time has come,  
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,  
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Heaven can wait,  
Heaven can wait,  
Heaven can wait,  
Heaven can wait til another day.  
  
I have a lust for the Earth below  
And Hell itself is my only foe,  
'Cause I've no fear of dying,  
I'll go when I'm good and ready,  
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays,  
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,  
At all of the people standing there in front of me,  
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,  
Is this the place where the living join the dead?  
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land,  
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality,  
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side,  
To see the truth, the path for you is decided.  
  
Oh oh lots.  
  
My body tingles, I feel so strange,  
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,  
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,  
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?  
Maybe I'm going down there as well,  
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.  
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,  
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?  
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?  
  
[Chorus]

"Believe in me, send us money  
Died on the cross and that ain't funny  
But my so called friends they're making me a joke  
They missed out what I said like I never spoke  
They choose what they want to hear, they don't tell a lie  
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die  
They're saving your souls by taking your money  
Flies around shit, bees around honey

Holy Smoke Holy Smoke, plenty bad preachers for  
The Devil to stoke  
Feed'em in feet first this is no joke  
This is thirsty work making Holy Smoke yeah  
making Holy Smoke  
  
Jimmy Reptile and all his friends  
Say they gonna be with you at the end  
Burning records burning books  
Holy soldiers nazi looks  
Crocodile smiles just wait a while  
Till the TV queen gets her make-up clean  
I've lived in filth I've lived in sin  
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holy Smoke, smells good  
  
They ain't religious but they ain't no fools  
When Noah built his cadillac it was cool  
Two by two they're still going down  
And the satellite circus just left town  
I think they're strange and when they're dead  
They can have a Lincoln for their bed  
Friend of the president trick of the tail  
Now they ain't got a prayer 100 years in jail

"I got the keys to view at number 22  
Behind my green door there's nothing to see  
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence, laid  
Back and looking for sympathy  
I like a girl who knows where she's bound  
I don't like girls who've been hanging around  
  
[Chorus]  
Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling  
For that well hung feeling  
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I  
Got the hooks screwed in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's tied up she can't come to the phone  
You must have got your wires crossed 'cause she ain't home  
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound  
She never could keep her feet on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Right on the money got it wrapped up tight  
New ideas for the decor tonight  
Gonna make this house a preservation zone  
Gonna set her in concrete set her up on her own

I can't see my feelings  
Open my eyes  
I can't see my feelings  
Open a pair of eyes  
I can't see my feelings  
Keep them behind  
I just keep on reeling  
Running back down the line  
Oh, I can't stand that screaming  
Don't even try  
Music fans some feelings  
It'll be tell me why  
I can't stop that feeling  
Showing me why  
Man I love that feeling  
Yeah, blowin' me right through the sky  
Oh hey hey hey hey hey hey  
Oh, listen to what she says  
If it's good, it's nice

"Infinite dreams I can't deny them  
Infinity is hard to comprehend  
I couldn't hear those screams  
Even in my wildest dreams  
  
Suffocation waking in a sweat  
Scared to fall asleep again  
Incase the dream begins again  
Someone chasing I cannot move  
Standing rigid nightmare's statue  
What a dream when will it end  
And will I transcend?  
  
Restless sleep the minds in turmoil  
One nightmare ends another fertile  
Getting to me so scared to sleep  
But scared to wake now, in too deep  
  
Even though its reached new heights  
I rather like the restless nights  
It makes me wonder it makes me think  
There's more to this I'm on the brink  
It's not the fear of what's beyond  
It's just that I might not respond  
I have an interest almost craving  
But would I like to get too far in?  
  
It can't be all coincidence  
Too many things are evident  
You tell me you're an unbeliever  
Spiritualist? well me I'm neither  
But wouldn't you like to know the truth  
Of what's out there to have the proof  
And find out just which side you're on  
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?  
  
Help me, help me to find my true  
Self without seeing the future  
Save me, save me from torturing  
Myself even within my dreams  
  
There's got to be  
More to it than this  
Or tell me why do we exist  
I'd like to think that when I die  
I'd get a chance another time  
And to return and live again  
Reincarnate, play the game  
Again and again and again and again

"My life is so empty, nothing to live for.  
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law.  
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran.

I'm running away, no where to go.  
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know, yeah,  
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true.  
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you, yeah

"Longboats have been sighted the evidence of war has begun  
Many Nordic fighting men their swords and shields all gleam in the sun  
Call to arms defend yourselves get ready to stand and fight for your lives  
Judgment day has come around so be prepared don't run stand your ground  
  
They're coming in from the sea  
They've come the enemy  
Beneath the blazing sun  
The battle has to be won  
Invaders, pillaging  
Invaders, looting  
  
Set ablaze the campfires alert the other men from inland  
Warning must be given there's not enough men here for a stand  
The Vikings are too many much too powerful to take on our own  
We must have reinforcements we cannot fight this battle alone  
  
They're coming over the hill  
They've come to attack  
They're coming in for the kill  
There's no turning back  
Invaders  
Fighting  
Invaders  
Marauding  
  
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground  
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around  
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle weary fight to the end  
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen  
  
You'd better scatter and run  
The battle's lost and not won  
You'd better get away to fight another day

I'll lift you up little bit higher  
  
I've got the fire  
I've got the fire  
  
So you think I'm skinny, don't you sell me cheap  
I'm as wide as a country-mile  
Some like it wide, I like it deep

"From the red sky of the east  
To the sunset in the west

And he has cheated us

And this is what it means  
We are sleeping  
And we'll dream for evermore  
  
And the fragment remains of our memories  
And the shadows remain with our hands  
Deep gray, came to mourn  
All the colors of the dawn  
Will this journeyman's day be his last?

I know what I want  
And I say what I want  
And no one can take it away  
I know what I want  
And I say what I want  
And no one can take it away  
  
But the memory still remains  
All the past years not so strange  
Our winter times are like a silent shroud  
And the heartbeat of the day  
Drives the mist away  
And winter's not the only dream around  
  
In your life you may choose desolation  
And the shadows you build with your hands  
If you turn to the light  
That is burning in the night  
Then the journeyman's day has begun

In your life you may choose desolation  
And the shadows you build with your hands

"A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyone  
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way  
I've been depressed so long  
It's hard to remember when I was happy  
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more  
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way  
the hardest part is to get on with your life  
  
You're searching in the dark  
clutching at straws to find a way  
You take the Tarot cards and throw them to the wind  
  
Your questions your beliefs,  
your inner thoughts, your whole existence  
And if there is a God then answer if you will  
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place  
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace  
  
If you could live your life again  
Would you change a thing or leave all the same  
If you had the chance again  
Would you change a thing at all  
When you look back at your past  
Can you say that you are proud of what we've done  
Are there times when you believe  
That the right you thought was wrong  
  
All of my life I have believed  
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me

"You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back  
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack  
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed  
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs  
  
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise  
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night  
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed  
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me  
  
I can see what a knife's meant to be  
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see  
  
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties  
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike  
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed  
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs  
  
Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night  
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light  
I have found you, and now there is no place to run  
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?  
Oh yeah, I've done it

"I feel the breeze on my face in expectance  
Not very long before the storm reaches here  
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again  
Feel something strong as the power draws near  
  
Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you  
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear  
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone  
It takes me back to my childhood again  
  
And as I wait and I look for an answer  
To all the things going round in my head  
I ask myself could it be a disaster and when  
It's maybe threatening to happen again  
  
As the ominous light draws near  
There's a lone dog howls in the park  
All the people hurry inside  
As a lightning flash lights dark  
The storm is nearly here  
Only God will know  
  
You're sitting alone you watch  
As the wind is blowing treetops  
And the swaying rustling leaves  
Plenty of time to perceive  
As you wait for rain to fall  
Only God knows  
The whole sky glows  
  
Maybe lightning strikes twice  
Maybe lightning strikes twice

"All my dark dreams  
Drift like smoke in the breeze

Here is the dream that makes monsters of men  
  
In the house of my soul  
In rooms of ugliness and cold  
Memories locked away  
All the doubts and fears I never faced  
  
Now they come again  
I am falling down to meet with them  
fear within us all  
Mine awake and they stand up tall  
  
Look for the truth  
Deepest cut of all from you  
Knife of the truth  
Blade of hatred slicing through  
  
I pray my sleep will break  
Maybe this time I won't wake  
Weakness I hide so well  
This dagger in my mind will tell  
  
It's my final stand  
I make a fist out of each hand  
To the shadows of the past  
Take a breath and I scream attack

Don't deny me what I am  
Nothing hidden still you fail to see the truth

These are things you can't reveal  
  
We are part of some strange plan  
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man  
Infernal sacrifice of hell  
Fire breathing lead the way  
Mounds of bodies as they all burn into one  
Revenge is living in the past  
Time to look into a new millennium  
  
Spiral path leads through the maze  
Down into the fiery underworld below  
Fire breathing lead the way  
Lucifer was just an angel led astray

Free your soul and let it fly  
Give your life to the Lord of Light  
Keep your secrets and rain on me

And blazing eyes  
We gather demons in the mirror every day  
The bridge of darkness casts a  
Shadow on us all  
And all our sins to you we give this day  
  
Others wait their turn  
Their lives were meant to last  
Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast  
Free your soul and let it fly  
Mine was caught I couldn't try  
Time returns again to punish all of us

We are strangers in this lonely promised land  
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost  
In our nightmare world the only one we trust

I just want to live my own fantasy  
Fate has brought us to these shores  
What was meant to be is now happening  
  
I've found that I like this living in danger  
Living on edge it makes feel as one  
Who cares now what's right or wrong,  
It's reality  
Killing so we survive  
Wherever we may roam  
Wherever we may hide  
We've got to get away  
  
I don't want existence to end  
We must prepare ourselves for the elements  
I just want to feel like we're strong  
We don't need a code of morality  
  
I like all the mixed emotion and anger  
It brings out the animal the power you can feel  
And feeling so high on this much adrenalin  
Excited but scary to believe what we've become  
  
Saints and sinners  
Something within us  
We are lord of flies  
  
Saints and sinners  
Something willing us  
To be lord of the flies

"The freeway is jammed  
And it's backed up for miles  
The car is an oven and baking is wild  
Nothing is ever the way it should be  
What we deserve we just don't get you see  
  
A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge  
Each step get closer to losing his head  
Is someone in heaven are they looking down  
Cause nothing is fair just you look around  
  
Falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down  
  
He's sick of waiting of lying like this  
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss  
Branded a leper because you don't fit  
In the land of the free  
You can't live by your wits  
  
Once he built missiles a nation's defence  
Now he can't even give birthday presents  
Across the city he leaves in his wake  
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state

"
"At a point below zero  
There's no place left to go  
Six hundred unknown heroes  
Were killed like sleeping buffalo  
  
Through the devil's canyon  
Across the battlefield  
Death has no companion  
The spirit is forced to yield  
  
There goes the bandolero  
Through the hole in the wall  
He's a coward but doesn't care though  
In fact, he doesn't care at all  
  
The general that's commanding  
He's defending what he fears  
While the troops they are depending  
On reinforcements from the rear  
  
If God is in the heavens  
How can this happen here?  
In His name, they used the weapons  
For the massacre  
  
There is a point below zero  
Where the sun can see the land  
Six hundred unknown heroes  
Lay dead in the sand

"
"I stand alone in this desolate space  
In death they are truly alive  
Massacred innocence, evil took place  
The angels were burning inside  
  
Centuries later I wonder why  
What secret they took to their grave  
Still burning heretics under our skies  
Religion's still burning inside  
  
[Chorus]  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
  
As we kill them all so God will know his own  
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne  
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal  
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross  
  
Templar believers with blood on their hands  
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand  
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty  
To stand with the catharsis, to die and be free  
  
The book of Old Testament crippled and black  
Satan - his weapon is lust  
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh  
Back to the torture of lies  
  
The perfect ones willingly died at the stake  
And all of their followers slain  
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed  
Religion's still burning inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As we kill them all so God will know his own  
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne  
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal  
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross  
  
Templar believers with blood on their hands  
Joined in the chorus to kill on command  
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty  
Still running herretics under our skies  
  
As we kill them all so God know his own  
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust  
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin  
No passover feast for the cursed within  
  
Facing the sun as they went to their grave  
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave  
Death is the price for your soul's liberty  
To stand with the catharsis and to die and be free  
  
[Chorus]

"Seven deadly sins  
Seven ways to win  
Seven holy paths to hell  
And your trip begins  
  
Seven downward slopes  
Seven bloodied hopes  
Seven are your burning fires  
Seven your desires  
  
I am he the born-less one  
The fallen angel watching you  
Babylon, the scarlet whore  
I'll infiltrate your gratitude  
Don't you dare to save your son  
Kill him now and save the young ones  
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe  
Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name  
  
Moonchild hear the mandrake scream  
Moonchild open the seventh seal  
  
I count the heads of those unborn  
The accursed ones I'll find them all  
And if you die by your own hand  
As a suicide you shall be damned  
And if you try to save your soul  
I will torment you, you shall not grow old  
With every second and passing breath  
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death  
  
Moonchild hear the mandrake scream  
Moonchild open the seventh seal  
Moonchild you'll be mine soon child  
Moonchild take my hand tonight  
  
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night  
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite  
Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul  
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die  
  
One more dies one more lives  
One baby cries one mother grieves  
For all the sins you will commit  
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give  
A web of fear shall be your coat  
To clothe you in the night  
A lucky escape for you young man  
But I'll see you damned in endless night  
  
Moonchild hear the mandrake scream  
Moonchild open the seventh seal  
Moonchild you'll be mine soon child  
Moonchild take my hand tonight

"Mother Russia how are you sleeping  
Middle winter cold winds blow  
From the trees the snowflakes drifting  
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow  
  
Mother Russia poetry majestic  
Tells the time of a great empire  
Turning round the old man ponders  
Reminiscing an age gone by  
  
Mother Russia  
Dance of the czars  
Hold up your heads  
Be proud of what you are  
Now it has come  
Freedom at last  
Turning the tides of history  
And your past  
  
Mother Russia  
Dance of the czars  
Hold up your heads  
Remember who you are  
Can you release  
The anger the grief  
Can you be happy  
Now your people are free

"
"Bleeding you dry from the start  
The sum of my parts  
To give it away  
New life in a day  
Some new Frankenstein  
Damned for all time  
  
Cursed by the angel who fell  
Who saves me from hell?  
And who is my god?  
And where is my soul?  
Too tired to jump too young to run  
  
[Bridge]  
Never ending, forever searching  
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart  
Always seeking, always asking  
Questions right from the start  
  
[Chorus:]  
Out beyond the new frontier  
Playing god without mercy, without fear  
Create a beast, made a man without a soul  
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man?  
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man?  
  
I want to end my life now  
But I don't know how  
Recycled again a lifetime of pain  
The spawn of a man  
The devil has planned  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]

"There are times when I've wondered  
And times when I've cried  
When my prayers they were answered  
At times when I've lied  
But if you asked me a question  
Would I tell you truth  
Now there's something to bet on  
You've got nothing to lose  
  
When I've sat by the window  
And gazed at the rain  
With an ache in my heart  
But never feeling the pain  
And if you would tell me  
Just what my life means  
Walking a long road  
Never reaching the end  
  
God give me the answer to my life  
God give me the answer to my dreams  
God give me the answer to my prayers  
God give me the answer to my being

"
"The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night  
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed  
Time it waits for no man  
My future it is revealed  
Time it waits for no man  
My fate is sealed  
  
If I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today  
Fly in the face of your prophets I mock your morality plays  
The moon is red and bleeding  
The sun is burned and black  
The book of life is silent  
No turning back  
  
[Chorus:]  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
Mystery madman a victim of cruel charade  
Some innocent pawn in an end game one more stalemate  
Is death another birthday?  
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?  
Do the undead live within us  
And look through our eyes?  
  
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust  
Measure your coffin does it measure up to your lust?  
So I think I'll leave you  
With your bishops and your guilt  
So until the next time  
Have a good sin  
  
[Chorus]  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
Seven deadly sins  
Seven ways to win  
Seven holy paths to hell  
  
Seven downward slopes  
Seven bloodied hopes  
Seven are your burning fires  
Seven your desires...

"In a foreign field he lay  
Lonely soldier, unknown grave  
On his dying words he prays  
Tell the world of Paschendale  
  
Relive all that he's been through  
Last communion of his soul  
Rust your bullets with his tears  
Let me tell you 'bout his years  
  
Laying low in a blood filled trench  
Kill Tim 'til my very own death  
On my face I can feel the falling rain  
Never see my friends again  
  
In the smoke, in the mud and lead  
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread  
Soon be time to go over the wall  
Rapid fire and the end of us all  
  
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire  
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire  
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb  
Be reunited with my dead friends soon  
  
Many soldiers eighteen years  
Drown in mud, no more tears  
Surely a war no-one can win  
Killing time about to begin  
  
Home, far away  
From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away  
But the war, no chance to live again  
  
The bodies of ours and our foes  
The sea of death it overflows  
In no man's land, God only knows  
Into jaws of death we go  
  
Crucified as if on a cross  
Allied troops they mourn their loss  
German war propaganda machine  
Such before has never been seen  
  
Swear I heard the angels cry  
Pray to god no more may die  
So that people know the truth  
Tell the tale of Paschendale  
  
Cruelty has a human heart  
Every man does play his part  
Terror of the men we kill  
The human heart is hungry still  
  
I stand my ground for the very last time  
Gun is ready as I stand in line  
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow  
Rush of blood and over we go  
  
Blood is falling like the rain  
Its crimson cloak unveils again  
The sound of guns can't hide their shame  
And so we die on Paschendale  
  
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire  
Running straight at the cannon fire  
Running blind as I hold my breath  
Say a prayer symphony of death  
  
As we charge the enemy lines  
A burst of fire and we go down  
I choke a cry but no-one hears  
Fell the blood go down my throat  
  
Home, far away  
From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away  
But the war, no chance to live again  
  
See my spirit on the wind  
Across the lines, beyond the hill  
Friend and foe will meet again  
Those who died at Paschendale

"White man came across the sea  
He brought us pain and misery  
He killed our tribes he killed our creed  
He took our game for his own need  
  
We fought him hard we fought him well  
Out on the plains we gave him hell  
But many came too much for Cree  
Oh will we ever be set free?  
  
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes  
Galloping hard on the plains  
Chasing the redskins back to their holes  
Fighting them at their own game  
Murder for freedom the stab in the back  
Women and children are cowards attack  
  
Run to the hills, run for your lives  
Run to the hills, run for your lives  
  
Soldier blue in the barren wastes  
Hunting and killing their game  
Raping the women and wasting the men  
The only good Indians are tame  
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold  
Enslaving the young and destroying the old  
  
Run to the hills, run for your lives

"Out in the street somebody's crying,  
Out in the night the fires burn,  
Maybe tonight somebody's crying,  
Reached the point of no return.  
  
Oh, my eyes they see but I can't believe,  
Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave.  
  
Like the eagle and the dove,  
Fly so high on wings above,  
When all you see can only bring you sadness,  
Like a river we will flow,  
On towards the sea we go,  
When all you do can only bring you sadness,  
Out on the sea of madness.  
  
Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling,  
Out in the dark there burns a dream,  
You got to hope when you are falling,  
To find the world that you have seen.  
  
Oh, my eyes they see but I can't believe,  
Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave.  
  
Like the eagle and the dove,  
Fly so high on wings above,  
When all you see can only bring you sadness,  
Like a river we will flow,  
On towards the sea we go,  
When all you do can only bring you sadness,  
Out on the sea of madness.  
  
It's madness,  
The sun don't shine  
On the sea of madness,  
There ain't no wind to fill your sails,  
Madness,  
When all you see can only bring you sadness  
On towards the sea we go

"Eleven saintly shrouded men  
Silhouettes stand against the sky  
One in front with a cross held high  
Come to wash my sins away  
  
Standing alone in the wind and rain  
Feeling the fear that is growing  
Sensing the change in the tide again  
Brought by the storm that is brewing  
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear  
Some of the doubt in the things you believe  
Now that your faith will be put to the test  
Nothing to do but await what is coming  
  
Why then is god still protecting me  
Even when I don't deserve it  
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength  
Some they would call it a penance  
Why am I meant to face this alone  
Asking the question time and again  
Praying to God won't keep me alive  
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise  
  
They'll be saying their prayers  
when the moment comes  
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgment day  
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes  
They'll be coming to claim,  
take your soul away  
  
The sign of the cross  
The name of the rose  
a fire in the sky  
The sign of the cross  
  
They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame  
They'll be bringing us all immortality  
Holding communion so the world be blessed  
My creator my God'll lay my soul to rest  
  
Lost the love of heaven above  
Chose the lust of the earth below  
Eleven saintly shrouded men  
Came to wash my sins away

"Start, with the sun  
And move on out

Oh what a time we had  
Living on the ground  
I've moved to station No. 5  
See you next time around,  
Next time around  
  
As far you want, as close as you need  
It's all in the mind, you know  
This old world hasn't really seen it's day  
It's here, time to go

Remember when it was so clear  
We were young, but the memory still remains  
To pick fruit from a tree  
Fish from the seas  
Now nothing's left here, but the stains  
Well I can't cry no more  
Can only be glad  
There's other places we can be  
If the time suits you right  
I'm leaving tonight  
Come fly away with me  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Start, with the sun  
And move on out  
The future's in the skies above  
The heavens unfold  
A new star is born  
Space and time makin' love

"Roll of the dice  
Take a spin of the wheel  
Out of your hands now  
So how do you feel  
But you're not gonna win  
You'd better go back again  
  
Do you feel lucky  
Or do you feel scared  
Take what luck brings  
And be Devil may care  
But you're down on your luck  
What will the next day bring  
  
Adrift on the ocean  
Afloat in a daydream  
Or lost in a maze  
Or blind in the haze  
So what does it matter  
So why don't you answer  
So why did you send  
An angel to mend  
  
Best make decisions  
Before it's too late  
Take all your chances  
Take hold of the reins  
A roll of the dice  
Ahead of the game again  
  
Nothing to lose  
But so much to gain  
A little danger  
It goes without saying  
But what do you care  
You're gonna go in the end  
Gate open to heaven  
  
Is ready and waytnig  
Or straight down to hell  
Can go there as well  
  
I'll suffer my craving  
My soul's not worth saving  
Sowhy don't you go  
Just leave well alone  
  
Don't you think I'm a savior  
Don't you think I could save you  
Don't you think I could save your life  
  
There's like a hunger  
That knocks on your door  
You've had a taste of it  
Still you want more  
You've made your mistakes  
Won't play it the same again  
  
You have been warned  
But still you plunge in  
You play high stakes  
But there's nothing to win  
You've only one life  
And so many things to learn  
  
The Angel on one side  
The Devil the other  
Which path do you take  
Decisions to make  
  
Arrive at the crossroads  
You know where you're going  
And what if you wait  
It may be too late

"I'm an educated fool  
So I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do  
About this awkward situation  
That's been forced down right upon me  
  
As I'm walking down into  
On my own into the valley of life  
Got a lifetime of experience  
Yeah I've got so much to give  
  
Open the page at chapter one  
Could this just be that life's just begun  
Forever within your darker thoughts Reflecting on everything you've been  
Taught  
  
Never felt this way before  
Seems that somebody's just opened the door  
To the book of life, or is it death!  
There's ever anyway out  
  
Someone's looking down on me  
To the very inner core of my soul  
They won't tell me what they see  
But I really want to know  
  
I want to leave my life on my own  
I want to lift the unturned stone  
I want to walk right into the fire  
I want to live out all my desires  
  
I want to go and see the fire burn  
I want to see and feel my world turn  
I want to know what more there's to learn  
I want to pass the point of no return  
  
Do you really want to be  
Just another one statistic or feel  
  
That you really should aspire  
That you really do deserve more  
  
Do you ever really fell  
That you have so much potential inside  
What you really have to give  
Could be realized so much more  
  
Time will flow  
And I will follow  
Time will go  
But I will follow  
  
I want to feel what life's like respond  
I want to meet my father beyond  
I want to walk right into the light  
I want to feel no fear but delight  
  
I want to leave my life on my own  
I want to lift the unturned stone  
I want to walk right into the fire  
I want to live out all my desires

"On a cold October morning  
As frost lay on the ground  
Waiting to make my move  
I make no sound  
  
Waiting for the mist to cover all around  
I carefully picked my time  
Then took the wall  
  
I'm sick and tired of running  
The hunger and the pain  
A stop to look about then off again  
  
Being at the wrong place  
And the wrong time  
Suspected of a hit that was my crime  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name  
  
Always looking 'round me  
Forever looking back  
I'll always be a target for attack  
  
Ever moving onwards  
Always on the run  
Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name  
  
Even if I find them  
And get to clear my name  
I know that things can never  
Be the same  
  
But if I ever prove  
My innocence some day  
I've got to get them all to make them pay  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name

"Tell you a thing  
That you ought to know  
Two minutes of your time  
Then on you go  
  
Tell tale of the men  
All dressed in black  
That most of them  
Not coming back  
  
Sent off to the war  
To play little games  
And on their return  
Can't name no names  
  
Some strange yellow gas  
Has played with their minds  
Has reddened their eyes  
Removed all the lies  
  
And strange as it sounds  
Death knows no bounds  
How many get well  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
You lie in your death bed now  
But what did you bring to the table  
Brought us only holy sin  
Utter trust is a deadly thing  
  
To the prayer of holy peace  
We didn't know what was lying underneath  
So how could we be such fools  
And to think that we thought you the answer  
  
I can't begin to understand in all the lies  
But on your death bed I can see it in you eyes  
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow  
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now  
  
Tangled up in a web of lies  
Could have been a way to prophesise  
Unaware of the consequence  
Not aware of the secrets that you kept  
  
Nothing that we could believe  
To reveal the facade of faceless men  
Not a thing that we could foresee  
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome  
  
You had us all strung out with  
Promises of peace  
But all along you cover plan was to deceive  
Can it put to rights now only time will tell  
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well  
  
Left to all our golden sons  
All to pick up on the peace  
You could have given all of them  
A little chance, at least  
  
Take the world to a better place  
Given them all just a little hope  
Just think what a legacy  
You know, will leave  
  
We seem destined to live in fear  
And some that would say Armageddon is near  
But where there's a life while there's hope  
That man won't self destruct  
  
Why can't we treat our fellow men  
With more respect and a shake of their hands  
But anger and loathing is rife  
The death on all sides is  
Becoming a way of life  
  
We live in an uncertain world  
Fear understanding and ignorance  
Is leading to death  
Only the corpses are left  
For vultures that prey on their bones  
  
But some are just not wanting peace  
Their whole life is death and misery  
The only thing that they know  
Fight fire with fire life is cheap  
  
But if they do stop to think  
That man is teetering right on the brink  
But do you think that they care  
They benefit from death and pain and despair

"Tough of the track,  
With the wind,  
And the rain that's beating down on your back.  
Your heart's beating loud  
And goes on getting louder  
And goes on even more till the sound  
Is ringing in your head,  
With every step you tread,  
And every breath you take,  
Determination makes  
  
You run,  
Never stop,  
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop,  
Keep the pace,  
Hold the race,  
Your mind is getting clearer,  
You're over halfway there but the miles  
Just never seem to end  
As if you're in a dream,  
Not getting anywhere.  
It seems so futile.  
  
Run, on and on,  
Run, on and on,  
The loneliness of the long distance runner.  
  
I've got to keep running the course,  
I've got to keep running and win at all costs,  
I've got to keep going, be strong,  
Must be so determined and push myself on.  
  
Run over stiles, across fields,  
Turn to look at who's on your heels,  
Way ahead of the field,  
The line is getting nearer but do  
You want the glory that goes,  
You reach the final stretch,  
Ideals are just a trace,  
You feel like throwing the race,  
It's all so futile.  
  
Run, on and on,  
Run, on and on,  
The loneliness of the long distance runner.

"Like a mirage riding on the desert sand  
Like a vision floating with the desert winds  
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands  
Your are the keeper of the mystery in your hands  
  
Nomad, rider of the ancient east  
Nomad, rider that men know the least  
Nomad, where you come from no one knows  
Nomad, where you go to no one tells  
  
Undercover of the veil of your disguise  
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise  
No one's certain what you future will behold  
You're a legend you own story will be told  
  
Nomad, rider of the ancient east  
Nomad, rider that men know the least  
Nomad, where you come from no one knows  
Nomad, where you go to no one tells  
  
No one dares to even look or glance your way  
Your reputation goes before you they all say  
Like a spirit that can disappear at will  
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill  
  
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious  
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us  
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands  
No man's ever understood your genius  
  
Those who see you in horizon desert sun  
Those who fear your reputation hide or run  
You send before you a mystique that's all your own  
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone  
  
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious  
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us  
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands  
No man ever understood your genius  
  
Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue  
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale  
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men  
Others say that you have died and live again  
  
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious  
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us  
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands  
No man ever understood your genius

"Woe to you, oh earth and sea  
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath  
Because he knows the time is short  
Let him who hath understanding  
Reckon the number of the beast  
For it is a human number  
Its number is six hundred and sixty six  
  
I left alone, my mind was blank, I needed time to think  
To get the memories from my mind  
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw  
That night was real and not just fantasy?  
  
Just what I saw in my old dreams  
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me  
'Cause in my dreams, it's always there  
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair  
  
Night was black, was no use holding back  
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?  
In the mist, dark figures move and twist  
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Hell and fire was spawned to be released  
  
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised  
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky  
In the night, the fires are burning bright  
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Sacrifice is going on tonight  
  
This can't go on, I must inform the law  
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?  
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes  
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
6 6 6, the one for you and me  
  
I'm coming back, I will return  
And I'll possess your body, and I'll make you burn  
I have the fire, I have the force  
I have the power to make my evil take its course

"
"The keys to death and hell  
The ailing kingdom doomed to fail  
The bonds of sin and heart will break  
The pilgrims course will take  
  
Quelling the devils might  
And ready for eternal fight  
Aching limbs and fainting soul  
Holy battles take their toll  
  
Liberty and hope divine  
Changing the water into wine  
So to you we bid farewell  
Kingdom of heaven to hell  
  
[Chorus:]  
Spirit holy life eternal  
Raise me up take me home  
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset  
Onward journey begun  
  
To courage find and gracious will  
Deliver good from ill  
Clean the water clean our guilt  
With us do what you will  
  
Then will my judge appear  
Bear no false angel that I hear  
For only then I will confess  
To my eternal hell  
  
Now give us our holy sign  
Changing the water into wine  
So to you we bid farewell  
Kingdom of heaven to hell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now give us our holy sign  
Changing the water into wine  
So to you we bid farewell  
Kingdom of heaven to hell

"Now that I know that the right time has come  
My prediction will surely be true  
The impending disaster it looms  
And the whole of the village is doomed  
Why won't you listen to me  
It is so hard to understand  
That I am the real seventh son  
Your life or death on me depends  
  
Suffering and pain impending disaster  
Souls crying the devil's laughter  
Heard the cry of the seven whistlers  
Lucifer smiles looks on and waits  
  
I'll take your life in my hands  
Your fate your fortune's in my visions  
Heed what I say and you'll see  
What will be  
Please listen to me  
  
Now that they see the disaster is done  
Now they put all the blame unto me  
They feel I brought on a curse  
Don't they know that the torment  
It stays with me knowing that I walk alone  
Through the eyes of the future I see  
They don't even know what fear is  
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed  
  
Purgatory beckons souls lost forever  
Life after death or heaven hereafter  
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again  
Now Lucifer laughs hell awaits

Their fate their fortunes in my visions  
No one believed in my true prophecy  
And now it's too late

Let me take you on an awkward journey, let me tell you why.  
Let me tell you why  
  
Why should these curses be laid upon me,  
I won't be forgiven 'til I can break free,  
What did I do to deserve all this guilt,  
Pay for my sins, for the sale of my soul.  
  
Demons are trapped all inside my head,  
My hopes of god, reach for heaven from hell,  
My sins are many, my guilt is too heavy,  
The question of knowing of how then what I know?

The lies of a thousand souls weigh heavy down on me  
  
I know they're crying for help reaching out  
The burden of them will take me down as well  
The sin of a tohusand souls knocked out in vain

"When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?  
Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost  
  
At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win  
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
We all like to put the blame on society these days  
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings  
  
Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart  
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever  
  
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad  
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane  
  
At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn  
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

"When you start to take a look within  
Do you feel at ease with what you see  
Do you think you can have peace of mind  
And have self-belief or be satisfied  
  
Do you think you even like yourself  
Or really think you could be someone else  
Is there something that you'd rather be  
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see  
  
All my life I've run away  
All my life I've tried to hide away  
  
Fell the paranoia creeping in  
Like a cancer eating at the skin  
Do you feel you've lost your self esteem  
And your self respect, what can you expect  
  
All my life, I've run astray  
Let my faith, slip away  
All my life, I've run astray  
Allowed my faith, to drift away  
  
Are you scared to look inside your mind  
Are you worried just at what you'll find  
Do you really want to face the truth  
Does it matter now, what have you got to loose  
  
Try to release the anger from within  
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins  
Do you really care what people think  
Are you strong enough to release the guilt

You watch the world exploding every single night  
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light  
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death  
Hello to eternity and live for every breath  
  
Your time will come, your time will come  
Your time will come, your time will come  
  
The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back  
He can push his own boat as you set up off the track  
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same  
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame  
  
You watch the world exploding every single night  
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light  
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain  
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again  
  
Your time will come, your time will come  
Your time will come, your time will come

Left behind the loved ones  
Waiting silent in the hall  
Where you're going lies adventure  
Others only dream of  
Red and green light this is real  
And so you go to war  
  
For the passion, for the glory  
For the memories for the money  
You're a soldier, for your country  
What's the difference, all the same  
  
Far away from the land of our birth  
We fly a flag in some foreign earth  
We sailed away like our fathers before  
These colors don't run, from cold bloody war  
  
There is no one that will save you  
Going down in flames  
No surrender certain death you  
Look it in the eye  
On the shores tyranny you  
Crashed a human wave  
Paying for my freedom with your  
Lonely unmarked graves  
  
For the passion, for the glory  
For the memories for the money  
You're a soldier, for your country  
What's the difference, all the same  
  
Far away from the land of our birth  
We fly a flag in some foreign earth  
We sailed away like our fathers before

Dream on sister, I hope you find the one  
All of our lives, covered up quickly  
By the tides of time

Spend your years full of loneliness  
Wasting love, in a desperate caress  
Rolling shadows of night  
  
Dream on brothers, while you can  
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one  
All of our lives, covered up quickly  
By the tides of time

In your eyes I see the hunger, and the  
Desperate cry that tears the night

Sucked into the feeding hole
