"7 am  
The garbage truck  
Beeps as it backs up  
And I start my day thinking about  
What I've thrown away  
Could I push rewind?  
All the credits strewn  
In signifying the end  
But I missed the best part  
Could we please go back  
To the start?  
Forgive my indecision  
  
Then again, then again, then again  
You're always first when  
No one's on your side  
Then again, then again, then again  
The day will come when  
I want off that ride  
  
11 am  
By now you would think  
That I would be up  
But my bedsheets shade  
The heated choices I made  
What did I find?  
I never thought I could want  
Someone so much  
'Cause now you're not here  
And I'm knee deep  
In my own fear  
Forgive my indecision  
I am only a man  
  
Then again, then again, then again  
You're always first when  
No one's on your side  
Then again, then again, then again  
The day will come when  
I want off that ride  
  
12 pm and my dusty telephone rings  
I get up from my pillow  
Who could it be?  
I hope its you  
It's you, oh  
  
Then again, then again, then again  
You're always first when  
No one's on your side  
Then again, then again, then again  
The day has come and  
I want off that ride

"A certain shade of green,  
Tell me, is that what you need?  
All signs around say move ahead.  
Could someone please explain to me your ever present  
Lack of speed?  
  
Are your muscles bound by ropes?  
Or do crutches cloud your day?  
My sources say the road is clear,  
And street signs point the way.  
Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.?  
  
What are you waiting for,  
A certain shade of green?  
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate.  
What are you waiting for,  
A certain shade of green?  
  
Would a written invitation  
Signed, ""Choose now or lose it all,""  
Sedate your hesitation?  
Or inflame and make you stall?  
You've been raised in limitation,  
But that glove never fit quite right.  
  
The time has come for hand-me-downs,  
Choose anew, please evolve,  
Take flight  
What are you waiting for?  
A written invitation?  
A public declaration?  
A private consolation?

"Meet me here  
On November 11th, come alone  
Bring your mouth  
And selective irreverence, we'll both see stars, just  
One more time  
Kiss before the sky falls  
Out from  
This cloud we're hovering on  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
Kill your doubt  
With the coldest of weapons, confidence  
And no more words  
Just the sound of resplendent, tongues colliding  
One more time  
Kiss before the sky falls  
Out from  
This cloud we're hovering on  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
Here I am, there you are  
On a wire connecting our hearts  
There's a string, and it's tied  
To a kite  
There's a storm in the sky  
Now the clouds become electric  
There you are, here I am  
Could I?  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off

"Could you move in slow motion?  
Everything goes by so fast  
Just slow down a little  
Save the best part for last

Your intentions turn me on  
I'm yours forever  
Will you love me when I'm gone?  
  
You're an unfenced fire  
Over walls we travel  
Its you I admire  
My living example  
  
Your eyes are an undiscovered ocean far away  
Any minute now keeping  
Both poets and priests at bay  
Don't get ahead of me  
Could we just this once see eye to eye?  
What you offer has me  
Ask me how it feels to vie  
  
Your an unfenced fire  
Over walls we travel  
Its you I admire  
My living example  
  
Its a photograph discovered a decade after  
Its a cannon blast disguised as a firecracker  
Its enough to bring a brick wall to its knees  
And sing, please  
  
Could you move in slow motion?

"I met the day  
Feeling cheaper than usual  
I guess you could say that I'm on sale  
So take what you can while you can  
Shop now intensive  
I could snap at any moment  
And I might feel more expensive  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't owe anything to you  
I don't owe anything to you  
You don't you know me half as well as you think you do  
I don't owe anything  
Anything to you  
  
I met the mirror  
The plastic hanging from my ear  
And in that moment I went unfazed  
So take what you can while you can  
Less conscious only means more gold  
I could snap at any moment and remember  
I was not born to be sold  
  
[Chorus: x2]

"I'm floating down a river  
Oars freed from their homes long ago  
Lying face up on the floor  
Of my vessel  
I marvel at the stars  
And feel my heart overflow  
  
Further down the river  
  
Two weeks without my lover  
I'm in this boat alone  
Floating down a river named emotion  
Will I make it back to shore?  
Or drift into the unknown  
  
Further down the river  
  
I'm building an antenna  
Transmissions will be sent  
When I am through  
Maybe we can meet again  
Further down the river  
And share what we both discovered  
Then revel in the view  
  
Further down the river  
  
I'm floating down a river

"Perfect night  
The moon shines bride  
But covered with blood  
Because this is an evil night  
Calls for a sign  
Is what the invokers are meditating  
The souls from beyond  
Are hearing them calling  
Moving objects  
Sinister sounds in the air  
Nerves tense  
Hands holding tight  
You can fell it answering everywhere  
The seekers are happy  
Thinking that they are hearing  
The voice from their loved one

Beyond the unknown  
Powerful spectre  
Closing in  
Is it a dream  
Or is it true  
Beyond the unknown  
Communication begun thru the incarnated body  
Of the spiritual leader  
Questions are asked, answers correct  
But they don't the real horrors  
Behind the spirit of the dead  
Ceremony is over now  
Relatives left in satisfaction  
Knowing that he's resting in eternal peace  
Days have passed  
Then there was a knocking at the door  
Live in the flesh  
The missing one that they thought was dead  
Memories coming back  
Realizing what they have heard  
Was nothing but a malignant force  
Telling them nothing but lies  
Chorus  
Beyond the unknown  
Powerful spectre  
Closing in  
Is it a dream  
Or is it true  
Beyond the unknown

"Today, everything was fine  
Until roundabout, quarter to nine  
I suddenly found myself in a bind  
Was it something I said?  
Something I read and manifested that's getting you down  
  
Don't you dare come to bed with that ambiguous look in your eye  
I'd sooner sleep by an open fire and wake up fried  
  
Say what you will  
Say what you mean  
You could never offend  
Your dirty words come out clean  
  
Tomorrow, what price will I pay?  
Could I make it all up to you by serving coffee for two in bed?  
Would you then gimme the time of day?  
  
I need a map of your head  
Translated into English  
So I can learn not to make you frown  
You'd feel better if you'd vent  
Put your frustrations into four letter words  
And let them out on mine  
The most weathered ears in town  
  
So say what you will  
Say what you mean  
You could never offend  
Your dirty words come out clean

Keep one of your eyes open at all times  
Think that you're on the brink?  
The shit hasn't even begun to hit the fan  
Consequence you'll see will be stranger than a gang of drunken mimes  
Situation has a stink  
Better clear the air before your son becomes a man  
  
Blink  
  
Everything's been augmented  
You've been left so far behind  
Think, for sure, next time you should wear a pair of eyes in the back of your  
head  
Consequence you've seen has been stranger than sci-fi of any kind  
Situation baffles me  
I guess it's true you are too one of the walking dead  
  
You better think fast!  
?Cause you never know what's comin' around the bend  
You better not blink!  
For consequence is a bigger word than you think  
It's bigger than you and me

"Fifteen minutes to six and fourteen floors to go  
Thirteen suited strangers make a crowded elevator slow  
And I've got a million words and phases on the tip of my tongue  
For the only non-stranger next to me, soon she'll know  
(let ?em stare)  
  
If I could  
I think I would give in  
And let you in on how I feel  
I need to spill  
Let it all out right now  
And expose every inch in front of them  
  
Twelve more floors  
And your eyes in mine are all I need to come clean  
Or should I wait until the lobby  
And spare the lives of some twenty-six nervous eyes  
Being occupied by the little red numbers passing by?  
If I wait one minute longer  
I think I will die  
(let ?em stare)  
  
If I could  
I think I would give in  
And let you in on how I feel  
I need to spill  
Let it all out right now  
Expose every inch in front of them  
  
You help me to feel, see and know why all the while I've been so inquisitive  
I can't go back ?cause now I know  
How it feels to open up and breathe

"Hades on the earth  
Condemned cities  
From evil populations  
Violence, fatal crimes  
Chaos will lead us to destruction  
The streets lost it's freedom to be crossed  
Imprisonment at any time  
When darkness takes it's proper place  
Fear closing in  
When the scenes terrorize honest citizens  
Disgust multiplies  
Serious acts are committed every day  
Fighting to survive in this labirinth  
Of stone and steel  
Always unware when and where  
The assault can actually occur  
CHORUS  
Curse of the damned cities  
Crucial habitats  
Following the way of criminal instincts  
Curse of the damned cities  
Unrighteous dwelling  
Decaying towards it's uncontrollable destiny  
Dreams of civilization  
Of peace and harmony, lies far away  
Are you alone in this fight  
To correct those corrupted societies  
Justice is a word that is fading real fast  
Guilty running free as the victims are suffering  
From the fact that there is no escape  
Feeling that their security is not strong enough yet  
Thefts, rapes, murders growing to a numerous rate  
We never seem to learn that this is an endless war  
Is the economy provoking it  
Or is it just the ignorant side of a human being  
Evil suppress intermittently every line  
Haunting frequently  
The streets are the battlefield  
To those individual warriors  
Where each man is like a country  
Fighting each other in a conventional war  
Mandatory action of survival  
CHORUS  
Curse of the damned cities  
Crucial habitats  
Following the way of criminal instincts  
Curse of the damned cities  
Unrighteous dwellings  
Decaying towards it's uncontrolled destiny  
Brutality growing, it never stops  
For centuries it seems to be getting worse  
Harshly tumultuous mobs  
Is home a safe place  
If now the danger is spreading across the land  
Like an epidemic without any curse  
We will never learn from our mistakes  
The more we stop, the more will emerge  
The experience are the lesson to make us fear  
CHORUS  
Curse of the damned cities  
Crucial habitats  
Following the way of criminal instincts

Swallow it down.  
A little bit of something instigating your frown.  
The moon on the town, the blood on your gown.  
You're always picturesque.  
Stomp the haunted mood in your crown.  
I used to think about it then I...  
Chose the word indulgence, now I...  
Just need some more to stand my own.

Who knows.  
Why I live this way?

Deep inside of our brains!)

Over and over, we ask ourselves why  
Don't we utilize things  
That are stored deep inside of our brains!

Am I sooo stoned that I can't see straight?

Electric word life  
That means forever and that's a mighty long time

There's something else  
The after world  
  
A world of never ending happiness  
You can always see the sun, day or night  
  
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills  
You know the one, Dr Everything will Be Alright  
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left  
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

Things are much harder than in the after world  
In this life  
You're on your own

Go crazy, punch a higher floor  
  
If you don't like the world you're living in  
Take a look around you  
At least you got friends  
  
You see I called my old lady  
For a friendly word  
She picked up the phone  
Dropped it on the floor  
Ah, ah is all I heard  
  
Are we gonna let the elevator  
Bring us down  
Oh, no Let's Go!  
  
Let's go crazy  
Let's get nuts  
Let's look for the purple banana  
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!  
  
We're all excited  
But we don't know why  
Maybe it's cause  
We're all gonna die  
  
And when we do (When we do)  
What's it all for (What's it all for)  
You better live now  
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door  
  
Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down  
Oh, no let's go!  
  
Let's go crazy  
Let's get nuts  
Look for the purple banana  
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

Let's get nuts  
  
Let's go crazy  
  
Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down

Will make everything go wrong  
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill  
Hang tough children  
  
He's coming  
He's coming  
Coming  
  
Take me away!

"We're given a garden  
And gave back a parking lot  
We got about fifteen minutes to go  
Before this audience  
Starts throwing tomatoes, yeah  
It?s not the end, there is more show  
We got about fifteen minutes to go  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked our heads above the mud  
No one?s immune, deafening bells  
My God, will we survive ourselves?  
I'm not an alarmist  
But someone should break the glass  
And pull that red T-lever down  
To get their attention  
Start lobbing the light grenades  
That burst and blind them with the truth  
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked our heads above the mud  
No one?s immune, deafening bells  
My God, will we survive ourselves?  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked out heads above the mud  
Wipe off your face, we've come this far  
Come on, remember who you are  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked our heads above the mud  
No one?s immune, deafening bells  
My God  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked out heads above the mud  
Wipe off your face, we've come this far  
Come on, remember who you are  
Come on, remember who you are  
Come on, remember who you are  
Remember, remember  
Come on, remember who you are  
Remember, remember  
Come on, remember who you are

"My hands are trembling  
And my eyes are on fire  
This house is crumbling  
Left brain, left out on the wire  
  
You make me happy  
You magnify my better half  
You make me certain  
That all I have today is your photograph  
  
My past is perilous  
And each scar I bear sings  
Monuments to where I have been  
And melodies to where I am going  
  
You make me happy  
You magnify my better half  
You make me certain  
That all I have today is your photograph  
  
When will I see you again?  
A still life can only go so far  
  
I need you in front of me  
Saying my name  
Saying to me  
Saying to me  
Saying to me  
I want you the way you are  
The way you are  
  
You make me happy  
You magnify my better half  
You make me certain  
That all I have today is your photograph  
  
You make me happy

"Alone in their destination  
Wandering thru this violent life  
A part of all misconception from their past  
And now thrown out to the street to rot  
Painful screams never heard  
Hung on the wings of death  
Germs are what they seem  
For the rich they have no need  
Left in the cold in crucial places  
Feeling the horrors of real life  
Places to places, no where to go  
Agonizing pain and no one seems to care  
Trying to revive 'em for a higher place  
But no one seems to give any support  
They hear their torment call  
Disarmed from an endless war  
Aimed by all kinds of poverty  
Vagabonds you will find in types of societies  
Resting in the underground of this materialistic  
Inferno  
Chorus  
Mortify  
In hostility of human injustice  
Some say that they're not concerned  
But never willing to take their burdens  
Let's hope it's not your skin  
Which is rotting of sins  
Chorus  
Mortify  
In hostility of human injustice  
They are living in a world of darkness  
In which the light seems far away  
No justice  
Blamed for someone else's deed  
Humiliation  
Because they are poor  
Treated harshly  
Is this what they call the advancement of mankind  
Why men want to rule the space  
While they can't even solve the problems of the earth  
Where is our humane sense now  
So much said, but so little done  
Blinded and devoured by our greed  
Facing all the worries of our minds  
We can't feel what is happening in the world around us  
Turbulence is the conflict which we all must face  
Crossing the line of stupidity and discrimination  
Is one of the reasons which makes us ignore  
The actual state of the moribund  
Breaking down their hope to piece  
Destitution increases in front of their own miserable lives  
Chorus  
Mortify  
In hostility of human injustice  
Days passed  
Injured ones dying fast  
Harsh temperatures  
The whips of cold winds  
Are frosting their bodies on the attack  
Feeling the rigor mortis stage alive  
Reaching to the ultimate muscular paralysis

"I am one big walking chemical reaction  
A buzzing hive of self synopsis and nascent self perception  
  
Isn't it disdainful and curious  
That both of us think we know everything  
  
We both have pains  
We both have eyes  
(Neither of us can see)  
We both have pains  
We both have eyes  
(Neither of us can see)  
One in the same  
Two of a kind  
And neither of us can see  
  
I am just a blinking neon roadside attraction  
I sow future wrinkles and I'm told I'm tapped potential

That both of us think we know everything  
  
We both have pains  
We both have eyes

So good to meet you we are one in the same

"At first I see an open wound  
infected and disastrous  
It breathes chaotic catastrophe  
it cries to be renewed  
Its tears are the color of anger,  
they dry to form a scab  
To the touch, its stiff and resilient,  
underneath, the new skin breathes  
As outwardly cliche as it may seem,  
yes, something under the surface says,  
""C'est la vie""  
It is a circle, there is a plan  
dead skin will atrophy itself to start again  
Look closely at the open wound  
see past what covers the surface  
Underneath chaotic catastrophe,  
creation takes stage.  
Its all been saved  
with exception for the right parts  
When will we be new skin?  
Its all been seen with exception for what could be  
When will we be new skin?  
Fallacious cognitions  
spewed from televisions  
do mold our decisions.  
So stop and take a look,  
and you'll see what I see now

"Better than watching Gellar  
Bending silver spoons  
Better than witnessing  
Newborn nebulas in bloom  
She who sees from up  
  
High smiles and surely sings  
Perspective pries her once  
Weighty eyes and  
It gives you wings  
I haven't felt the way  
I feel today  
  
In so long its hard  
For me to specify  
I'm beginning to notice  
How much this feels like  
A waking limb  
Pins and needles  
Nice to know you  
Goodbye  
Nice to know you  
  
Deeper than the deepest  
Coustou would ever go  
Higher than the heights of what  
We often think we know  
Blessed she who clearly  
Sees the wood for the trees  
To obtain a bird's eye is to  
Turn a blizzard to a breeze  
  
I haven't felt the way  
I feel today

Been there all along

"Will I ever get to where I'm going?  
Will I ever follow through with what I had planned?  
  
I guess it's possible that I have been a bit distracted  
And the directions for me are a lot less in demand  
  
Will I ever get to where I'm going?  
If I do, will I know when I'm there?  
If the wind blew me in the right direction  
Would I even care?  
  
I would  
I take a look around  
It's evident the scene has changed  
And there are times when I feel improved upon the past  
Then there are times when I can't seem to understand at all  
And yes it seems as though I'm going nowhere  
Really fucking fast

"You and I are like oil and water  
We've been trying, trying, trying  
To mix it up

We've been crying, crying, crying  
The oh blackened souls  
This wouldn't be the first time  
It will not be the last time  
There is no better soul that can shelter this weather  
  
I've been smiling with birds on my shoulder  
I've been dying, dying, dying  
To let them go  
  
Well this wouldn't be the first time  
It will not be the last time  
There is no better soul that could shelter this weather  
Babe this wouldn't be the first time  
It will not be the last time  
We tried to believe everything could get better

Lying to each other, hey babe

What it is

"Die by violence in this world  
Is nothing strange for us  
With all those chemicals, wars and destructions  
We do not know what mother nature has in store for us  
The race for economy  
Makes people forget  
The lives around this planet  
As men become more egoistic  
Pretty soon, there will be nothing in this world  
For men to spare  
Stupidity  
Causing pain  
And sickness  
To our world  
Suffer

We might not have any future to be found  
On this burial ground  
We have nowhere to hide  
Death is laughing at our crimes  
And now we are feeling the effects  
That the forces of nature has brought  
The droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions  
It's getting worse than ever before  
We can see the revenge of this planet upon us  
As we keep hurting the sea, the soil and the air  
Sometimes some catastrophic accidents happen  
Causing death rate and we wonder from where  
People are dying in civilizations of different lands  
Because of drought  
Occurrences of flooding everywhere  
Killing innocent people and leaving others in despair  
Abomination because people fear that all these events  
Happen without any warning killing unexpectedly  
Men subjugate the forces of nature  
But we don't know that it's destroying us slowly  
The animals are becoming extinct  
Seas and rivers polluted by toxic waste  
Combustible smoke  
Factories are creating acid rains  
That is burning our skins, damaging plantations  
And soon it will us to death  
Air pollution is disintegrating our atmosphere  
Allowing the ultra-violet rays to burn the earth  
Ad to provoke us fear  
Chorus  
On the burial ground  
Is what this planet is all about  
It's where we are right now  
We might not have any future to be found  
On this burial ground  
We have nowhere to hide  
Death is laughing at our cries  
Soon some of the lives on this planet  
Won't exist anymore  
Because we won't be able to recreate  
Some of the beauty that we had before  
Nobody seems to care  
About the future of our children's civilizations  
We better act now  
So they won't have a life of torment and frustration  
Stupidity  
Causing pain  
Punishment for violating  
The ecologic balance  
Chorus  
On the burial ground  
Is what this planet is all about  
It's where we are right now  
We might not have any future to be found  
On this burial ground  
We have nowhere to hide  
Death is laughing at our face  
Cursed by men this world has become  
We are building our own tombs  
By eliminating our source of life  
When blindly we continue the destructions  
There's no future  
Day by day we are reaching the end of our lives

"To resist is to piss in the wind  
Anyone who does will end up smelling  
  
Knowing this, why do I defy?  
Because my inner voice is yelling  
  
There is a fist pressing against  
Anyone who thinks something compelling  
  
Our intuit we're taught to deny  
And our soul we're told is for selling  
  
Get out from under them  
Resist and multiply  
Get out from under precipice  
And see the sky  
  
Get out from under them  
Resist, unlearn, defy  
Get out from under the precipice and see the sky

"In my fantasy, I'm a pantomime  
I'll just move my hands and everyone sees what I mean  
Words are too messy  
And it's way past time  
To end in my mouth  
  
Paint my face white and tried  
Reinvent the sea one wave at a time  
Speak without my voice  
And see the world by candlelight  
  
I ain't afraid to let it out  
I'm not afraid to take that fall  
But I have found beyond all doubt  
We say more by saying nothing at all  
  
In my fantasy, no such thing as time  
Minutes bleed into days, avant garde  
Show me your heresies  
And I'll show you mine  
We only speak in pantomimes on this carpet ride  
  
I ain't afraid to let it out  
I'm not afraid to take that fall  
But I have found beyond all doubt'

In my hair and skin and spit and sweat and spilled red wine

"A decade ago  
I never thought I would be  
At twenty-three  
On the verge of spontaneous combustion  
Wo-is-me  
  
But I guess that it comes with the territory  
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity  
I need you to hear  
I need you to see that I have had all that I can take  
And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me  
  
So pardon me while I burst into flames  
Pardon me while I burst into flames  
I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games  
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same  
  
Not two days ago  
I was having a look in a book  
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee  
I said, 'I can relate?'  
Cause lately I've been thinking of combustication  
As a welcomed vacation  
From the burdens of the planet earth  
  
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D  
And thinking so much differently  
  
So pardon me while I burst into flames  
I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games  
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same  
  
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D  
And thinking so much differently

Speak to me the way you do  
Bleeds me to believe that you  
Never stepped out of the  
Skin you live within, but when  
And if this day occurs  
Your tongue the taste will imitate  
A battery the anti-equilibrius  
Your stomach becomes the floor  
  
The look on your face was priceless  
  
A light goes on upstairs  
The attic ablaze  
This island isn't big enough  
For both of us who will swim  
In ell infested oceans  
Kiss the sand goodbye because  
The tide is coming up and in  
Ya water water water everywhere  
And every chance to sink  
  
Its an amalgamation of the things  
You aren't the ways you wish you were  
A split second perceiving of the way  
You really look to everyone of them  
I wish that you could get a glimpse  
I wish that you could see because

Up in the ??? ??? ??? with you

They lost their head and claim it's all my fault  
I'm fed koolaid intravenously  
I must regain my own autonomy!

The purple kool-aid cult is back, I'm paranoid again  
Would someone please appease all the stress of my,

Sorry friend, there's no way I can stay  
Wish I could explain the reason why  
I'm being chased so please pardon my haste  
Please appease the stress of my brown head.

Looked back for a flash and I began to shout  
I've got to find a passage out of here  
I'm not too certain that the future's clear  
And now I'm alone and to what type too wear  
And then they set upon a skinny chair  
They're gathering now around a sugar throne  
It's red and round and speaks of miracles.

And penance in a locket, dropping from the highest floor  
When it hits ground I watch it smash to pieces  
Songs of liberation echo from the dust, the dust  
  
Enough  
  
Bowing down to disillusion  
Hats off and applause to rogues and evolution  
The ripple effect is too good not to mention  
If you're not affected, you're not paying attention  
It?s too good, too good, not to have an effect  
  
Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough  
Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough  
  
Bowing down to disillusion  
Hats off and applause to rogues and revolution  
The ripple effect is too good not to mention  
If you're not affected, you're not paying attention  
It?s too good, too good, too good, yeah

"Alone in my house  
Full of hate and fear  
Your death is near  
My passion for killing will take you to death  
I slay a victim I torture his wife  
They die by my knife  
I'm coming for you  
So take your last breath  
The more I kill, the more the need grows  
I dislodge the eyes and hack off the nose  
[CHORUS]  
I'm a sadistic sinner  
I will slash you at will  
It is the devil inside me  
Who makes me wanna kill  
Evil  
And you will die by my hand  
Killer  
And I'll make you understand  
Possessed  
Just like the knife in my hand  
Killer  
He taunts my soul and he twists my mind  
The blood of my victims is all they can find  
I dismember the body as its blood is being sprayed  
I gaze in splendor at the mess I have made  
Cold is the blade  
I carry in rage  
They live in fear  
My passion for killing will take you to death  
My soul is a demon that no one can save  
I spread my disease  
I'm coming for you  
So take your last breath  
The more I kill, the more the need grows  
I dislodge the eyes and hack off the nose  
[CHORUS]  
I'm a sadistic sinner  
I will slash you at will  
It is the devil inside me  
Who makes me wanna kill  
I'm  
Sadistic  
Sinner  
I'll kill you slow, I'll kill you fast  
I'm coming for you, I'll kick your ass.

"You took our lives away  
To increase your self esteem.  
An underlie in the public eye.  
Your dubbed insane if and when you try to  
Speak your mind  
In your own way!  
Ignore the past and  
  
Speak free!  
You smashed glass eyes just to say,  
""it all is all that I need.""  
What you see  
Is a reflection of my choice  
And what it means to me.  
Trapped in your cell.  
  
A mindless plot against own eyes  
To simplify your hell!  
Just ease my pain!

Coppin' a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky  
Puffin the lye, from my Twinzito  
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico  
We go back like PA's and wearin' PJ's  
Now we reach the peak age, runnin' trains for three days

Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla  
My, my, I'm big huh, I rip my, through your

But you know Big Pun and Brock still down behind  
I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'

Long as you show class, and pass my test  
Fat, highly intelligent bachlorettes  
That's the best, I won't settle for less  
I wanna get a brunette, with unforgettable sex  
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat  
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep, and just spark the  
It's hard to creep since I found Joe  
Every pretty round brown, wanna go down low  
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know  
Once I quit the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go  
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere  
You nasty Brock, I don't care  
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns  
Take time, known to make a chick  
Up in the hot tub, bubbly  
Rubbin' your spot love, got you screamin', ?Punish me?  
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked  
When I stick it even Luke be like, 'Don't stop, get it get it'

"What if your brain,  
Unexpectedly and suddenly,  
Picked out things to flip around  
And view a lot differently?  
What if blue sky,  
All of a sudden turned a purple hue?  
We would shit a brick the size of all of it  
  
What if?  
What if I was just daydreaming?  
What if I lived in a pear?  
What if my watch read 4:20 every hour, every day?  
You can bet your dollar I'd be happy!  
I forgot to remember,  
I forgot to remember my pain.  
  
Take me to your leader  
Or die by the fly guy!  
What if mothballs,  
Hangin' around too close to microwaves  
Suddenly woke up and said,  
""Take me to your leader  
Or die by fly guy!  
He'll push ya' out,  
No wings attached!""  
Just do as I say, no mistake,  
He'll blow away.  
  
What if I was daydreaming?  
What if I lived in a pear?  
What if I had a mustard drenched cucumber  
Tied to my leg and I  
Did not want my pants to get dirty?  
What if this, what if that?!  
Go! I forgot to remember  
I forgot to remember my pain. Take me to your leader  
Or die by the fly guy!  
  
I forgot to remember my, pain!  
My pain!  
Forgot to inject my, cocaine!  
Forgot to apply my, rogaine!  
Forgot to remember, my pain!  
  
I never think, I never thought,  
Oh maybe I'm insane!  
I think I like being  
Way the fuck out of my brain!  
  
I forgot to remember,  
I forgot to remember my pain.  
Take me to your leader  
Or die by the fly guy!

"Love, love is a verb  
Love is a doing word  
Fearless on my breath  
Gentle impulsion  
Shakes and makes me lighter  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Teardrop on the fire  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Nine night of matter  
Black flowers blossom  
Fearless on my breath  
Black flowers blossom  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Teardrop on the fire  
Fearless on my  
  
Water is my eye  
Most faithful mirror  
Fearless on my breath  
Teardrop on the fire of a confession  
Fearless on my breath  
Most faithful mirror  
Fearless on my breath

Fearless on my breath

"(Mm, hemp?)  
Step outside the bounds and take a  
Big look at the times we live in.  
Who appointed you?  
You're just an avid image on my screen.  
So take your bias point of view away from  
My organic institution.  
And now we D.A.R.E. to think ourselves!  
The answer's waiting content.  
(Look into your mind and guide.)  
The answer's clear as day open your eyes!  
  
Now kill me.  
You killed the very thing that keeps us  
Hanging on to our dear lives.  
So, in a sense you bit the hand that feeds us  
Just to kill your prophet now.  
And with the coming generation at the torn seems  
This is what you call progress  
  
I call it shame!  
The answer's waiting content.  
(Look into your mind and guide.)  
The answers clear as day open your eyes!  
  
Now kill me.  
What his law says.  
What his law says.  
What his law says may not be the stepping stone for you!  
You killed the very thing that keeps us hanging on to our dear lives!

"I'd like to close my eyes and go numb  
But there's a cold wind coming from  
The top of the highest high rise today  
  
It's not a breeze ?cause it blows hard  
Yes and it wants me to discard the humanity I know  
Watch the warmth blow away  
  
Do you think I should adhere  
To that pressing new frontier  
And leave in my wake a trail of fear?  
  
Or should I hold my head up high  
And throw a wrench in spokes by  
Leaving the air behind me clear?  
  
Don't let the world bring you down  
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold  
  
Remember why you came and while you're alive  
Experience the warmth before you grow old

"
"When I close my eyes  
I can see for miles  
There's comfort in my dark seat  
And chaos in the aisles  
  
These eyes are not your eyes  
And these eyes are not the color that  
Your arid eyes might be  
No, I was not around  
When those eyes of yours decided so  
I refuse to kneel before the  
Sights you choose to see  
  
When I close my eyes  
I remember why I smile  
Under my umbrella  
I'm an accomplished exile  
  
These eyes are not your eyes  
And these eyes are not the color that  
Your arid eyes might be  
No, I was not around  
When those eyes of yours decided so  
I refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see!  
  
If this is right, I'd rather be wrong  
If this is sight, I'd rather be blind  
  
These eyes are not your eyes  
And these eyes are not the color that  
Your arid eyes might be  
No, I was not around

"They kill for a reason  
They'll strike anyone  
Doesn't matter how old or young  
Pay'em big cash, they'll give'em a slash  
Explain how it should be done  
A shot in the head  
The man cut in half  
Tortured 'till death  
You'll never see him back  
  
[Chorus:]  
Underground killers  
They are everywhere  
Killing for money  
They don't care  
Leaving their victims covered with blood  
Underground killers  
Will make a mess  
Whose killing plans have been set  
Murdering their victims without mercy  
They promise to make it worse  
Tell'em their next mission  
And they'll give'em death  
Burn him alive  
A high voltage jolt  
A stab in the back  
They pomise you'll see him dead

Slay the victim to death  
Dead bodies everywhere  
Brutality is their authority  
Killers are not afraid of death

Killing for money  
They don't care  
Leaving their victims covered with blood  
Underground killers  
Will make a mess  
Whose killing plans have been set  
Murdering their victims without mercy  
They promise to make it worse  
More massacre for the long future generation  
Their customers are the only police source of information  
You've paid'em in full  
For the dirty job they've done  
Now you must die  
Like the other ones.

"Damn, this situation's new to me, why?  
I see a head afraid to be himself,  
I bet he'd to have a little  
Encouragement from the opposite,  
Come that side of the floor, Yes!  
  
Egg him along, make him feel at ease with himself,  
Steal his clothes, leave him his shoes,  
Let's get this marmaduke naked!  
Makehim feel at ease,  
Let's get this maraduke naked  
So lose your head and go to pieces  
  
Don't you make fun of me  
Don't you make fun of me!  
I'm gonna be, gonna be,  
I'm gonna be a hot dancer!  
Oh, now that the basics are down,  
Converse amongst yourselves.  
  
But, keep an eye out for the next complication.  
In other words,  
Grab the next motherfucker marmaduke,  
Who refuses to submit to these pelvic ostentations.  
I can't wait until the syllables bend.  
Let's get this marmaduke naked,  
Let's get this marmaduke naked  
So lose your head and go to pieces!

Don't you make fun of me!

Gonna be,  
I'm gonna be a hot dancer!
