"I can't help it, I'm not sure what to do  
Does seem crazy, no good for my health  
I've seen the doctor, he's come to look at me  
If you don't believe it, don't believe  
  
Closer all the time, Closer all the time  
Closer all the time, Closer all the time  
  
Now I'm saying how I'm going to need a pill  
I need you like a drug to keep my fill  
I can't remember everything I do  
Now I put them, it's only good to you  
  
Closer all the time, Closer all the time  
Closer all the time, Closer all the time  
  
You can't help but look me in the eye  
While I come running, I don't know why  
It's an addiction, image of love  
Your heart pushing, angel from above  
  
Closer all the time, Closer all the time  
Closer all the time, Closer all the time  
Closer all the time, Closer all the time  
Close!

"I know it's hard to reach you  
I know it's hard to breathe  
I know it's hard to be you sometimes  
I can't imagine what that means  
  
This must be someone else's story  
I can't follow what you've planned  
How could this be about me  
Am I supposed to understand?  
  
Like a ship on the ocean  
Heading out to sea  
You can hardly see it now  
It's a lot like you  
Lost like me  
  
You're still looking for redemption  
Still can't find a trace  
If there is nothing after  
There 'll be the saving grace  
  
I'm giving you control now  
I need some kind of sign  
Can't take away the sorrow now  
I gave you all that's mine  
  
Like a ship on the ocean  
Heading out to sea  
You can hardly see it now  
It's a lot like you  
  
Like a ship on the ocean  
Heading out to sea  
You can hardly see it now  
It's a lot like you  
Lost like me

"Let's take a map of the world  
Tear it into pieces  
All of the boys and the girls  
Will see how easy it is  
  
[Chorus]  
To put it all down and start again  
From the top to the bottom, and then  
I'll have faith, or I prefer  
To think that things couldn't turn out worse  
  
All that we need at the start's  
Universal revolution (that's all)  
And if we trust in our hearts  
We'll find the solution's  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Took a plane across the world  
Got in a car  
And when I reached my destination  
I hadn't gone far  
  
Let's take the whole of the world  
The mountains and the sand  
Let all the boys and the girls  
Shape it in their hands  
  
[Chorus]

"She remembered all the shadows and the doubts  
The same film  
  
Vivid pictures like a wall that's standing empty  
And the night so still  
  
Such a small affair, a relapse  
Someone closing like the nightclub door  
  
Here again and when you speak  
I watch you move away  
And seem so sure  
  
She is hoping to forget  
And the moment almost slips away  
  
When the colours move apart  
And I wonder if you want to stay  
  
And I need to change you  
Like the words I'm reading  
Don't you understand  
  
This the warning and the message  
I remember as you touch my hand

"
"Do you mean this horny creep  
Set upon weary feet  
Who looks in need of sleep  
That doesn't come  
This twisted, tortured mess  
This bed of sinfulness  
Who's longing for some rest  
And feeling numb  
What do you expect of me  
What is it you want?  
Whatever you've planned for me  
I'm not the one  
A vicious appetite  
Visits me each night  
And won't be satisfied  
Won't be denied  
An unbearable pain  
A beating in my brain  
That leaves the mark of Cain  
Right here inside  
What am I supposed to do?  
When everything that I've done  
Is leading me to conclude  
I'm not the one  
Whatever I've done  
I've been staring down the Barrel of a Gun  
Is there something you need from me?  
Are you having your fun?  
I never agreed to be  
Your Holy One  
Whatever I've done  
I've been staring down the Barrel of a Gun

"My little girl  
Drive anywhere  
Do what you want  
I don't care  
Tonight  
I'm in the hands of fate  
I hand myself  
Over on a plate  
Now  
Oh little girl  
There are times when I feel  
I rather not be  
The one behind the wheel  
Come  
Pull my strings  
Watch me move  
I do anything  
Please  
Sweet little girl  
I prefer  
You behind the wheel  
And me the passenger  
Drive  
I'm yours to keep  
Do what you want  
I'm going cheap  
Tonight  
You're behind the wheel, tonight

You are part of the sum  
What has been going on?  
Your confidence has gone  
You have seen better days  
You have lived better ways  
What are you waiting for?  
Answers that question more  
Uninvited they will come  
Are you expecting some?  
You have seen better days  
You have lived better ways  
Only time will tell  
What will come of you  
Only crime could sell  
What you're trying to  
Where are you heading to?  
What plans will you pull through?  
With trouble in the wings  
Will you risk anything?  
You have seen better days  
You have lived better ways

Black Celebration  
Tonight  
To celebrate the fact  
That we've seen the back  
Of another black day  
I look to you  
How you carry on  
When all hope is gone  
Can't you see  
Your optimistic eyes  
Seem like paradise  
To someone like  
Me  
I want to take you  
In my arms  
Forgetting all I couldn't do today  
Black Celebration  
Black Celebration  
Tonight  
To celebrate the fact  
That we've seen the back  
Of another black day  
I look to you  
And your strong belief  
Me, I want relief  
Tonight  
Consolation  
I want so much  
Want to feel your touch  
Tonight  
Take me in your arms  
Forgetting all you couldn't do today  
Black Celebration

Black Celebration  
Tonight

"Clean  
The cleanest I've been  
An end to the tears  
And the in-between years  
And the troubles I've seen  
Now that I'm clean  
You know what I mean

Put an end to it all  
I've changed my routine  
Now I'm clean

What destiny's planned  
I'm starting to grasp  
What is in my own hands  
I don't claim to know  
Where my holiness goes  
I just know that I like  
What is starting to show  
Sometimes  
Clean  
The cleanest I've been  
An end to the tears  
And the in-between years  
And the troubles I've seen  
Now that I'm clean  
You know what I mean  
I've broken my fall  
Put an end to it all  
I've changed my routine  
Now I'm clean  
As years go by  
All the feelings inside  
Twist and they turn  
As they ride with the tide  
I don't advise  
And I don't criticise  
I just know what I like  
With my own eyes  
Sometimes  
Clean  
The cleanest I've been  
An end to the tears  
And the in-between years  
And the troubles I've seen  
Now that I'm clean  
You know what I mean  
I've broken my fall  
Put an end to it all

"Condemnation  
Tried  
Here on the stand  
With the book in my hand  
And truth on my side  
Accusations  
Lies  
Hand me my sentence  
I'll show no repentance  
I'll suffer with pride  
If for honesty  
You want apologies  
I don't sympathize  
If for kindness  
You substitute blindness  
Please open your eyes  
Condemnation  
Why  
Because my duty  
Was always to beauty  
And that was my crime  
Feel elation  
High  
To know I can trust this  
Fix of injustice  
Time after time  
If you see purity  
As immaturity  
Well it's no surprise  
If for kindness  
You substitute blindness  
Please open your eyes

"We're damaged people  
Drawn together  
By subtleties that we are not aware of  
Disturbed souls  
Playing out forever  
These games that we once thought we would be scared of  
  
When you're in my arms  
The world makes sense  
There is no pretense  
And you're crying  
When you're by my side  
There is no defense  
I forget to sense I'm dying  
  
We're damaged people  
Praying for something  
That doesn't come from somewhere deep inside us  
Depraved souls  
Trusting in the one thing  
The one thing that this life has not denied us  
  
When I feel the warmth of your very soul  
I forget I'm cold  
And crying  
When your lips touch mine  
And I lose control  
I forget I'm old  
And dying

Will I take my rest in my Sunday best?  
Mother, are you anxious?  
Father, are you gracious?  
I'm coming home  
  
I've been away too long  
For so long you've been strong  
I've been away too long  
I know that it was wrong  
But I'm coming home  
  
Well, I'm knocking on Death's door  
Will I take my rest, have I passed the test?  
Mother, are you praying?  
Father, I am saying  
I'm coming home

"Light switch  
Man switch  
Film was broken only then  
All the night  
Fused tomorrow  
Dancing with a distant friend  
  
Filming and screening  
I picture the scene  
Filming and dreaming  
Dreaming of me  
  
So we left  
Understanding  
Clean cut so we're sounding fast  
Talked of sad  
I talked of war  
I laughed and climbed the rising cast  
  
Quickly I remembered  
Fused and saw a face before  
Timing reason  
Understanding  
Like association hall

"The handshake  
Seals the contract  
From the contract  
There's no turning back  
The turning point  
Of a career  
A career, of being insincere  
The holiday  
Was fun packed  
The contract  
Still intact  
The grabbing hands  
Grab all they can  
All for themselves  
After all  
It's a competitive world  
Everything counts in large amounts  
The graph  
On the wall  
Tells the story  
Of it all  
Picture it now  
See just how  
The lies and deceit  
Gained a little more power  
Confidence  
Taken in  
By a sun tan  
And a grin  
The grabbing hands  
Grab all they can  
All for themselves  
After all  
It's a competitive world  
Everything counts in large amounts  
The grabbing hands  
Grab all they can  
Everything counts in large amounts

There are flies on the windscreen  
For a start  
Reminding us  
We could be torn apart  
Tonight  
  
Death is everywhere  
There are lambs for the slaughter  
Waiting to die  
And I can sense  
The hours slipping by  
Tonight  
  
Come here  
Kiss me  
Now  
Come here  
Kiss me

Think I've been here before  
This place seems so familiar  
But then I can't be sure  
Here comes that time again when  
You'll walk right out the door  
Don't tell me secrets anymore  
  
And fools don't run away  
You'll be followed another day  
And all the chances that fall your way  
Are in the fire on your dying day  
So call me now and tell me that you're home  
  
Can't see the sense in crying  
There's too many tears to fall  
My thoughts are multiplying  
So I'll try to save them all

"Well it's a fragile tension,  
That's keeping us going.  
It may not last forever,  
But oh, when it's flowing.  
  
There's something magical in the air.  
Some things so tragic we have to care.  
  
It's a strange obsession,  
That's's drawing us nearer.  
We don't understand it,  
It never gets clearer.  
  
There's something mystical in our genes.  
So simplistic it kicks and screams.  
  
Oh when we're teetering  
On the edge of the collapse,  
Nothing can keep us down.  
  
It's a dizzying feeling  
That's keeping us flying.  
Some glittering galas,  
Without even trying.  
  
There's something radical in our hands.  
Nothing logical to our plans.

Listen to your spirit sighing  
I can feel your desperation  
Emotional deprivation  
Let yourself go  
Let yourself go  
Let your feelings show  
Picking up the conversations  
Deep in your imagination  
Tune in to the lonely voices  
Talking of their only choices  
Let yourself go  
Let yourself go  
Let your spirit grow  
Step out of your cage and onto the stage  
It's time to start playing your part  
Freedom awaits  
Open the gates  
Open your mind  
Freedom's a state  
I can taste the tears falling  
The bitterness that's inside you calling  
Yearning for a liberation  
Emotional emancipation  
Let yourself go  
Let yourself go  
Let your senses overflow  
Step out of your cage and onto the stage  
It's time to start playing your part  
Freedom awaits  
Open the gates  
Open your mind  
Freedom's a state

Why do you smile the smile you do

Pass between our eyes  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Pass between our thighs

Just to see if she was real  
Just to watch the smile fade away  
And see the pain she'd feel  
  
Wanted to feel her joy  
Feel it deep within  
Wanted to feel her joy  
Penetrate my skin

Why do you smile the smile you do

Silently

I dissolve in trust  
I will sing with joy  
I will end up dust

I stand in golden rays  
Radiantly  
I burn a fire of love  
Over and over  
  
Reflecting endless light  
Relentlessly  
I have embraced the flame  
Forever and ever  
  
I will scream The Word  
Jump into the void  
I will guide the world  
Up to heaven

Moved, my soul's on fire  
Moved, by a higher love  
I surrender all control  
To the desire that consumes me whole  
Leads me by the hand to infinity  
Lies in wait at the heart of me  
Moved, lifted higher  
Moved, my soul's on fire  
Moved, by a higher love  
Heaven bound on the wings of love  
There's so much that you can rise above  
Moved, lifted higher  
Moved, moved, by a higher love  
By a higher love  
I surrender heart and soul  
Sacrificed to a higher goal  
Moved, moved by a higher love  
By a higher love

"Here is a song from the wrong side of town  
Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound  
And it pounds from within and is pinning me down  
Here is a page from the emptiest stage  
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made  
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid  
And I thank you for bringing me here  
For showing me home  
For singing these tears  
Finally I've found that I belong here  
The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets  
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet  
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat  
And I thank you for bringing me here  
For showing me home  
For singing these tears  
Finally I've found that I belong  
Feels like home  
I should have known  
From my first breath  
God send the only true friend I call mine  
Pretend that I'll make amends the next time  
Befriend the glorious end of the line  
And I thank you for bringing me here  
For showing me home  
For singing these tears  
Finally I've found that I belong here

Dancing with you all the time, and don't you think that it's a crime

And still you give me everything  
But everything's not enough

To give myself to you

And I'll try  
Come on over lay down beside me  
And I'll try  
And I'll try  
  
I want it all

Exercise your basic right  
We could build a building site  
From the bricks of shame is built the hope  
If you want to be with me  
If you want to be with me  
Even though you may still not want to  
  
Let tomorrow and today  
Bring a life of ecstasy  
Wipe away your tears of confusion

Trying to furnish proof  
And though they speak with eloquence  
There is little truth

At least to some degree  
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough

I'm watching your serenity  
The way your soul transcends  
Their tedious obscenities  
You're patience never ends  
  
And as the night begins to fade  
You are heading for the door  
Followed by a sad parade  
You're on your own once more

You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong  
At least to some degree

Talking to you now  
Telling you clearly

Rush over me  
Heighten my senses  
Enlighten me  
Lead me on  
Eternally  
  
And the spirit of love  
Is rising within me  
Talking to you now  
Telling you clearly  
The fire still burns  
  
I'm talking to you now  
The fire still burns  
Whatever you do now  
The world still turns

"I am happy  
That I have you  
Even though you're not here now  
I know somewhere  
You are dreaming  
Though it's definitely not of me  
  
It doesn't matter  
If this all shatters  
Nothing lasts forever  
But I'm praying  
That we're staying  
Together  
  
I am warmed by  
Your friendship  
Even when you're far away  
And I'm happy  
In the knowledge  
We may never see the day  
  
When I kiss you  
And you kiss me  
Don't pretend you miss me  
The worst kind  
Of diseased mind  
Is one filled with jealousy  
  
If we should meet again  
Don't try to solve the puzzle  
Just lay down next to me  
And please don't move a muscle  
  
I will thank you  
Most of all for  
The respect you have for me  
I'm embarrassed  
It overwhelms me  
Because I don't deserve any  
  
It doesn't matter  
If this all shatters  
Nothing lasts forever  
But I'm praying  
That we're staying  
Together

"There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you, would you keep it safe for me  
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
There's a sun shining in the sky  
But that's not the reason why I'm feeling warm inside  
The answer isn't classified- it's my heart  
From the moment I started  
I tried to be good about it  
Yes I've tried my best  
And more or less, I spoke from my heart  
There's a lot to be learned  
And you learn when your heart gets burned

There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
Hearts can never be owned  
Hearts only come on loan  
If I want it back  
I will take it back  
I'll take my heart  
But I will try my best  
And more or less  
I will speak from my heart  
Yes, I will speak from my heart  
Speak from my heart

"They call you Jezebel  
Whenever we walk in  
You're going straight to hell  
For wanted acts of sin - they say,  
And that I'll have to pay  
But I need you just this way  
  
They call you Jezebel  
For what you like to wear  
You're morally unwell  
They say you never care for me  
But what the fail to see is that your games are the key  
  
Open their eyes to the beauty  
Open their hearts to the fun  
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone  
  
They call you Jezebel  
Whenever men walk by  
They say that they can tell  
The longing in your eyes is real  
And how you really feel  
But they can't see your appeal  
  
Jezebel

Take him up to the highest high  
Take him up to the top where the mountains stop  
Let him tell his book of lies  
  
John the Revelator  
He's a smooth operator  
It's time we cut him down to size  
Take him by the hand  
And put him on the stand  
Let us hear his alibis  
  
By claiming God as his only rock  
He's stealing a god from the Israelite  
Stealing a god from a Muslim, too  
There is only one god through and through  
  
Seven lies, multiplied by seven, multiplied by seven again  
Seven angels with seven trumpets  
Send them home on the morning train  
Well who's that shouting?  
John the Revelator!  
All he ever gives us is pain  
Well who's that shouting?  
John the Revelator!  
He should bow his head in shame

You help her forget  
The world outside  
You're not part of it yet  
And if you could drive  
You could drive her away  
To a happier place  
To a happier day  
That exists in your mind  
And in your smile  
She could escape there  
Just for a while  
Little fifteen  
Little fifteen  
Why take the smooth with the rough  
When things run smooth  
It's already more than enough  
She knows your mind  
Is not yet in league  
With the rest of the world  
And its little intrigues  
Do you understand  
Do you know what she means  
As time goes by  
And when you've seen what she's seen  
you will  
Little fifteen  
Little fifteen  
Why does she have to defend  
Her feelings inside  
Why pretend  
She's not had a life  
A life of near misses  
Now all that she wants  
Is three little wishes  
She wants to see with your eyes  
She wants to smile with your smile  
She wants a nice surprise  
Every once in a while  
She wants to see with your eyes  
She wants to smile with your smile  
She wants a nice surprise  
Every once in a while

This is more than a party  
More than a party  
More than a party  
  
Keep telling us we're to have fun  
Then take all the ice cream so we've got none

And in an instant the laughter's gone  
  
Loads of surprises in store

Amen to anything that brings a quick return

When this world is trying it's hardest  
To leave me unimpressed  
Just one caress  
From you and I'm blessed  
When you think you've tried every road  
Every avenue  
Take one more look  
At what you found old  
And in it you'll find something new  
I'm shying from the light  
I always loved the night  
And now you offer me eternal darkness  
I have to believe that sin  
Can make a better man

Those things  
But when I'm asleep  
I want somebody  
Who will put their arms around me  
And kiss me tenderly  
Though things like this  
Make me sick  
In a case like this  
I'll get away with it

"
"My little girl  
Won't you come with me  
Come with me  
And tell me  
Is there something to do  
I'm going crazy with boredom  
Come with me  
Tell me  
Grey sky over a black town  
I can feel depression  
All around  
You've got your leather boots on  
I can't stand another drink  
It's surprising this town  
Doesn't sink  
You've got your leather boots on  
Your pretty dress is oil stained  
From working too hard  
For too little  
You've got your leather boots on  
You're feeling the boredom too  
I'd gladly go with you  
I'd put your leather boots on  
I'd put your pretty dress on  

"
"Here  
As I sit  
At this empty cafe  
Thinking of you  
I remember  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
Though the world  
Is my oyster  
It's only a shell  
Full of memories  
Here by the Seine  
Notre-Dame casts  
A long lonely shadow  
Now only sorrow  
No tomorrow  
There's no today for us  
Nothing is there  
For us to share  
But yesterday  
This is my song  
This is my song  
This is my song  
These cities may change  
But there always remains  
My obsession  
Through silken waters  
My gondola glides  
And the bridge  
it sighs  
I remember  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
There's no more time for us  
Nothing is there  
For us to share  
But yesterdays  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again

"Take a look at unselected cases  
You'll find love has been wrecked  
By both sides compromising  
Amounting to a disastrous effect  
  
You hear stories of old  
Of princes bold  
With riches untold  
Happy souls  
Casting it all aside  
To take some bride  
To have the girl of their dreams  
At their side  
But not me  
I couldn't do that  
Not me  
I'm not like that  
  
I couldn't sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love  
  
I really like you  
I'm attracted to you  
The way you move  
The things you do  
I'll probably burn in hell  
For saying this  
But I'm really in heaven  
Whenever we kiss  
But Oh no!  
You won't change me  
You can try  
For an eternity  
  
I wouldn't sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love  
  
Now I've got things to do  
You have too  
And I've got to be me  
You've got to be you  
So take my hand  
And feel these lips  
And let's savour a kiss  
Like we'd savour a sip  
Of vintage wine  
One more time  
Let's surrender  
To this love divine  
  
But we won't sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love

"
"Where were you when I fell from grace  
Frozen heart, an empty space  
Something's changing, it's in your eyes  
Please don't speak, you'll only lie  
I found treasure not where I thought  
Peace of mind can't be bought  
Still I believe  
  
[Chorus]  
I just hang on  
Suffer well  
Sometimes it's hard  
It's hard to tell  
  
An angel led me when I was blind  
I said take me back, I've changed my mind  
Now I believe  
From the blackest room, I was torn  
He called my name, a love was born  
So I believe  
  
[Chorus: x2]

"
"Laying on your holy bed  
by the hallowed door  
Feeling like an infidel  
Not worthy of your call  
Tempted by your innocence  
Beckoned to my fate  
I won't face the consequence  
I wouldn't hesitate  
  
I'm a man of flesh and bone  
Rapture, rushing through my veins  
Passion, flaming, in my heart  
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah  
  
Shackled like an animal  
Chained to my desires  
Just another sacrifice  
To love's eternal fires  
Tame me with your tenderness  
And break my brittle heart  
Easily and elegantly  
Tear my world apart  
  
I'm a man of flesh and bone  
Rapture, rushing through my vains  
Passion, flaming, in my heart  
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah  
  
We're living in a world full of illusion  
Everything is so unreal  
My mind is in a state of confusion  
But I can't deny the way I feel  
  
I'm a man of flesh and bone  
Rapture, rushing through my veins  
Passion, flaming, in my heart  
Heavenly surrender  
  
I'm a man of flesh and bone  
Rapture, rushing through my veins  
Passion, flaming, in my heart, yeah

"The sweetest perfection  
To call my own  
The slightest correction  
Couldn't finely hone  
The sweetest infection  
Of body and mind  
Sweetest injection  
Of any kind  
I stop and I stare too much  
Afraid that I care too much  
And I hardly dare to touch  
For fear that the spell may be broken  
When I need a drug in me  
And it brings out the thug in me  
Feel something tugging me  
Then I want the real thing not tokens  
The sweetest perfection...  
Things you'd expect to be  
Having effect on me  
Pass undetectedly  
But everyone knows what has got me  
Takes me completely  
Touches so sweetly  
Reaches so deeply  
I know that nothing can stop me  
Sweetest perfection  
An offer was made  
An assorted collection  
But I wouldn't trade  
The sweetest perfection...  
Takes me completely  
Touches so sweetly  
Reaches so deeply  
Nothing can stop me  

"
"Like a cat dragged in from the rain  
Who goes straight back out and do i all over again  
I'll be back for more  
Something that is out of our hands  
Something we will never understand  
  
It's a hidden law  
The apple falls  
Destiny calls  
I follow you  
  
Like a pawn on the eternal board  
Who's never quite sure what he's moved towards  
I walk blindly on  
And heaven is in front of me  
Your heaven beckons me enticingly  
  
When I arrive it's gone  
The river flows  
The wise man knows  
I follow you  
  
I'm yearning I'm burning  
I feel love's wheels turning  
Like a moth on love's bright light  
I will get burned each and every night  
  
I'm dying to  
The sun will shine  
The bottom line  
I follow you  
  
I'm yearning I'm burning  
I feel love's wheels turning  
Like a moth on love's bright light  
I will get burned each and every night  
  
I'm dying to(o)  
The sun will shine  
The bottom line  
I follow you  
The sun will shine  
The bottom line  
I follow you

"The landscape is changing  
The landscape is crying  
Thousands of acres of forest are dying  
Carbon copies from the hills above the forest line  
Acid streams are flowing ill across the countryside  
  
'Cause I don't care if you're going nowhere  
Just take good care of the world  
I don't case if you're going nowhere  
Just take good care of the world  
  
Now we're re-arranging  
There's no use denying  
Mountains and valleys, can't you hear them sighing  
Evolution, the solution or the certainty  
Can you imagine this intrusion of their privacy  
  
Token gestures, some semblance of intelligence  
Can we be blamed for the security of ignorance

"
"Oh the tears that you weep  
For the poor tortured souls  
Who fall at your feet  
With their love begging bowls  
All the clerks and the tailors  
The sharks and the sailors  
All good at their trades  
They'll always be failures  
Alms for the poor  
For the wretched disciples  
And the love that they swore  
With their hearts on the bible  
Beseeching the honor  
To sit at your table  
And feast on your holiness  
As long as they're able  
Love needs its martyrs  
Needs its sacrifices  
They live for your beauty  
And pay for their vices  
Love will be the death of  
My lonely soul brothers  
But their spirit shall live on in  
The hearts of all lovers  
Your holding court  
With your lips and your smile  
Your body's a halo  
Their minds are on trial  
Sure as Adam is Eve  
Sure as Jonah turned whaler  
They're crooked love thieves  
And you are their jailer  
Love needs its martyrs  
Needs its sacrifices  
They live for your beauty  
And pay for their vices  
Love will be the death of  
My lonely soul brothers  
But their spirit shall live on in  
The hearts of all others  
Love will be the death of  
My lonely soul brothers  
But their spirit shall live on in  
The hearts of all others

"[Chorus]  
If I could just hide  
The sinner inside  
And keep him denied  
How sweet life would be  
If I could be free  
From the sinner in me  
  
I'll never be a saint  
That's not a picture that your memory paints  
Not renowned for my patience  
I'm not renowned for my restraint  
But you're always around  
You can always be found  
To pick me up when I'm on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm still recovering  
Still getting over all the suffering  
More known for my anger  
Than for any other thing  
But you've always tried  
To be by my side  
And catch my fall when I start to slide  
  
[Chorus]

"
"Taken in by the delicate noise  
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder  
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice  
Wandering around in silent wonder  
  
What chance did I have  
With the silver moon  
Hanging in the sky  
Opening old wounds?  
  
Taking hold of the hem of your dress  
Cleanliness only comes in small doses  
Bodily whole, but my head's in a mess  
Fueling obsession that borders psychosis  
  
It's a sad disease  
Creeping through my mind  
Causing disabilities  
Of the strangest kind  
  
Getting lost in the folds of your skirt  
There's a price that I pay for my mission  
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt  
How I suffer the sweetest condition  
  
Taken in by the delicate noise  
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder  
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice  
Wandering around in silent wonder

"
"I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
But they know me better than that  
They know me better than that  
They know my weaknesses  
I never tried to hide them  
They know my weaknesses  
I never denied them  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
How can a view become so twisted  
How can a view become so twisted  
They know my weaknesses  
I never tried to hide them  
They know my weaknesses  
You tried them  
I get so carried away  
You brought me down to earth  
I thought we had something precious  
Now I know what it's worth  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I've never felt so disappointed  
Never felt so disappointed  
They know my weaknesses  
I never tried to hide them  
They know my weaknesses  
Thought that you liked them  
They know me better than that

"We're lying by the orange sky  
Two million miles across the land  
Scattered to the highest high  
Expect they'll either laugh or cry  
No sex, no consequence, no sympathy  
You're good enough to heat  
  
Two minute warning  
Two minutes later  
When time has come  
My days are numbered  
  
The dawning of another year  
Marks time for those who understand  
One in four still here  
While you and I go hand in hand  
No radio, no sound, no sin, no sanctuary  
So welcome to your last  
  
The sun, the solitude, the cemetery  
So welcome to your last

"
"Well it's about time  
It's beginning to hurt  
Time you made up your mind  
Just what is it all worth  
  
All my useless advice  
All my hanging around  
All your cutting down to size  
All my bringing you down  
  
Watch the clock on the wall  
Feel the slowing of time  
Hear a voice in the hall  
Echoing in my mind  
  
All your stupid ideals  
Got your head in the clouds  
You should see how it feels  
With your feet on the ground  
  
Here I stand the accused  
With your fist in my face  
Feeling tired and bruised  
With the bitterest taste  
  
All my useless advice  
All my hanging around  
All your cutting down to size  
All my bringing you down  
  
All your stupid ideals  
Got your head in the clouds  
You should see how it feels  
With your feet on the ground

Sometimes i can feel you in the air

Hey you're such a pretty boy

Everybody wants to know your name

Feeling bright just tonight  
Hear them say you're out of sight

"To the soul's desires  
The body listens  
What the flesh requires  
Keeps the heart imprisoned  
  
What the spirit seeks  
The mind will follow  
When the body speaks

I'm just an angel  
Driving blindly  
Through this world  
  
I'm just a slave here  
At the mercy  
Of a girl

Oh, I need your touch  
Oh, I dream of one caress  
Oh, I pray too much

Please stop wasting

Naked  
Skin on skin  
Tears are falling  
Tears of joy  
Her first boy  
His first girl  
Makes a change  
  
In a world full of nothing  
Though it's not love  
It means something  
  
She's lonely  
And he says  
It's for her only  
That he lusts  
She doesn't trust him  
Nothing is true  
But he will do  
  
In a world full of nothing  
Though it's not love  
It means something  
  
It's not easy to slip away  
And believe it all  
  
Though it's not love  
It means something

Around the world and back

You just sit still  
Now let your mind do the walking  
And let my body do the talking  
Let me show you the world in my eyes  
I'll take you to the highest mountain  
To the depths of the deepest sea  
We won't need a map, believe me  
Now let my body do the moving  
And let my hands do the soothing  
Let me show you the world in my eyes  
That's all there is  
Nothing more than you can feel now  
That's all there is  
Let me put you on a ship  
On a long, long trip  
Your lips close to my lips  
All the islands in the ocean  
All the heaven's in the motion  
Let me show you the world in my eyes  
That's all there is  
Nothing more than you can touch now  
That's all there is  
Let me show you the world in my eyes
