You there, comin' up the stair, the feelin' is ice-blue cold.  
Shake, it's more than I can take, I'm startin' to lose control.  
Watch out, what's that noise, there's somebody at the door.  
It must be black licorice, she come back to make me cry some more.  
  
Time, ain't on my side, I'm losin' it more each day.  
Licorice, licorice.  
She's got evil in her eyes, and catnip is her taste.  
Licorice, licorice.  
She wraps me up in her slender legs, her hot black skin to mine.  
Licorice, licorice.  
Ple ... ple ...please, don't touch me, oh, I know I'm dead this time.

"I think I'm headed for a terrible accident.  
Made more plans than anyone who ever paid their rent.  
I'm not stupid and I might be havin' too much pride.  
Surgeon general has determined that I may as well die.  
  
Jesus are you watching or have you gone blind.  
Evil souls are upon us and we're surely runnin' out of time.  
  
Chorus  
I tried religion and some holy roller steals my tenth.  
In the grave yard I ain't strong enough to jump the fence.  
Some men they say they got more soul than both my shoes.  
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin' dues.  
  
I might be workin' on a scene that I can never act.  
Everybody's gonna think that my mind is cracked.  
I don't care because it's my right to win or lose.  
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin' dues.  
  
Crazy, am I crazy for wanting so much more.  
My mind says I can't ever give up but I still can't be sure.  
  
Chorus  
  
Can we ever stop payin' dues.  
Can we ever stop payin' dues.  
Can we ever stop payin' dues.

"I Can Feel Him In The Morning  
  
Child 1:  
He kind of started all the plants growing, and he started people. Well, I
guess he's kind of big and fat.  
  
Child 2:  
He can see us wherever we do ... whatever we do. He has such powerful eyes --
he has to have millions and thousands and billions. And he can still see us
when we're bad.  
  
Child 3:  
He could be sitting on the table right now, but you can't see him.  
  
Child 4:  
He can't be everywhere at once doing everything for everybdy. Everybody can't
get what they want.  
  
Child 5:  
Well, his job is to make us good and to make us happy and make us parents
happy.  
  
Child 6:  
Good is the right thing and bad is the wrong thing.  
  
Child 7:  
When I'm good my mother never yells at me, when I'm bad she does.  
  
Child 8:  
Good means to obey your mother and father, to do what the teacher says -- the
things right. I feel miserable when I'm ... when I'm bad, I feel miserable on
the inside but, on the outside, I just feel like I ... I feel now.  
  
Child 9:  
I think ... um, um ... there are more people that are bad than there are good.
And, um ... if you're good, you'll live forever. And, if you're bad, you'll
die when you die ... (repeat last sentence two more times to fade in echo)  
  
Take me down to the water, let me feel it run over me.  
Let me feel the pain and the coldness, the loneliness that there must be.  
Whoa, can't you see their dreams, as they go drifting by?  
Whoa, can't you see their faces, and their tear-soaked eyes?  
  
CHORUS  
I can feel him in the morning, I can feel him in the evening too.  
I can hear him in the morning, tellin' me what I got to do.  
Got to make a new world, ought to make the old one right.  
I can see him in the morning, I can see him in the stars at night.  
  
Take me out to the battlefield, let me hear the shells flying by.  
Let me hear the sound of the cannons, let me hear them scream and cry.  
Whoa, can't you hear their dreams, as they tumble to the blood-soaked ground?  
Whoa, hear them scream for shelter, from the world they never found.
