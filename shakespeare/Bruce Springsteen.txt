"We fell in love and I made you the world  
I spent all my time tryin' to satisfy you, girl  
Just one thing that I can't figure out  
Closer I get, farther baby I am out  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
The roof was leakin' honey where we live  
And I'm wonderin' what's that something that you won't give  
I started loving you but I gotta stop  
You got me mostly waitin' for that other shoe to drop  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
You keep me six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
Tried to talk about what's goin' on  
You just smile and tell me ""Baby there ain't nothin' wrong""  
In your smile there's a sign in red  
It said ""Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead""  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
Yeah I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt

"Well don't move  
Why don't you listen to what I'm saying  
And hey you  
You better get up if you plan to be staying  
Get loose  
You got to listen to what the band is playing  
Oh tonight  
There's action in the street all night  
We're bopping to the big beat, go  
Get up off your seat and roll  
At school  
The girls you know their dancing, mister 's just my speed  
And hey cool  
If action is the thing you need  
Well don't fool  
The kid's satisfaction guaranteed  
Oh tonight  
There's action in the street all night  
We're bopping to the big beat, go  
Get up off your seat and roll  
Well hey man  
Yeah don't let the little girl sigh  
Understand  
If you just move your body side to side  
Raise your hand  
Shout until you're satisfied  
Oh tonight  
There's action in the street all night  
We're bopping to the big beat, go  
Get up off your seat and roll

"Blind man wavin' by the side of the road  
I'm in a flat bed Ford carrying a heavy load  
With a sweet thing sippin' on a blueberry wine  
On a flat black highway down in Carolina  
Black bird slippin' in a sky of blue  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, honey  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
  
Little boy carryin' a fishin' pole  
Little girl pickin' berries straight off of the vine  
Brown bag filled with a little green toad  
We hook 'em through the lip and throw 'em off of the line  
Your sweet brown legs got me feeling so blue  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Mama go to church now, Mama go to church now  
Friday night daddy's shirt is torn  
Daddy's goin' downtown, daddy's goin' downtown

Field turned up, the seed is sowed  
Rain comin' in from over 'cross the road  
Big black curtain coming 'cross the field  
Blind 'll see, the lame will be healed  
Brown eyed girl, I turned my back on you, now it's lonely  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe

"I was born saved in heaven  
It was nothing like the promised land  
Raised in a good christian house  
Underneath a good christian hand  
I was schooled down and dirty  
Signed a note back to town  
It was there that the workers slaved all week  
Waiting for payday to come around  
  
Break out, come on if you're coming  
Cause baby i just can't stay  
I want to take out the walls of this joint  
I want to blow this town away  
  
Now i ain't into fast livin'  
I ain't into dying young  
And i ain't looking to be forgiven  
For any of the stupid things that i've done  
  
For the ones who once had a notion  
A notion it was good to be alive  
Feel the spark, the rush of emotion  
I want to break out baby tonight  
  
I want to dream, that i got a place  
I want to scream in somebody's face  
Make it seem, get out of this muddy race  
All night long  
  
Well all little kings lose their thrones tonight  
All you little pretty things better learn to sleep alone tonight  
It was down in the cool dirty living  
With the man with the master plan  
Some girl who can beg forgiveness  
And a ticket to the promised land  
  
Down where they'll tear your guts out  
Making out what you're all about  
Making while we were blasting like a ??  
I want out i want out i want out  
  
Want out to the outside  
Well i'm a small fool  
I want to shout i'm bound for nothing  
I want to shout about something too  
  
For the ones who once had a notion  
It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive  
I feel the heat, the rush of devotion  
I want to tear out baby tonight  
  
I wanna do what ain't ever been done  
I wanna win what ain't ever been won  
I wanna lose blow it all away  
I wanna lose what i've always won  
Prove it all night long  
  
I wanna know that i got a place  
I wanna go where i can see your face  
I wanna rock the roof off this place  
I want you to know  
I wanna live

"I got a dollar in my pocket  
There ain't a cloud up above  
I got a picture in a locket  
That says baby I love you  
Well if you didn't look then boys  
Then fellas don't go lookin' now  
Well here she comes a-walkin'  
All that heaven will allow  
  
Say hey there mister bouncer  
Now all I want to do is dance  
But I swear I left my wallet  
Back home in my workin' pants  
C'mon Slim slip me in man  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
I can't be late I got a date  
With all that heaven will allow  
  
Rain and storm and dark skies  
Well now they don't mean a thing  
If you got a girl that loves you  
And who wants to wear your ring  
So c'mon mister trouble  
We'll make it through you somehow  
We'll fill this house with all the love  
All that heaven will allow  
  
Now some may want to die young man  
Young and gloriously  
Get it straight now mister  
Hey buddy that ain't me  
'Cause I got something on my mind  
That sets me straight and walkin' proud  
And I want all the time  
All that heaven will allow

"I know what it's like to have failed, baby  
With the whole world lookin' on  
I know what it's like to have soared  
And come crashin' like a drunk on a bar room floor  
  
Now you got no reason to trust me  
My confidence is a little rusty  
But if you don't feel like bein' alone  
Baby, I could walk you all the way home  
  
Well now our old fears and failures  
Baby, they do linger  
Like the shadow of that ring  
That was on your finger  
Those days they've come and gone  
Baby, I could walk you all the way home  
  
Love leaves nothin' but shadows and vapor  
We go on, as is our sad nature  
Now it's some old Stones'  
Song the band is trashin'  
But if you feel like dancin'  
Baby, I'm askin'  
  
It's comin' on closing time  
Bartender, he's ringin' last call  
These days I don't stand on pride  
And I ain't afraid to take a fall  
  
So if you're seein' what you like  
Maybe your first choice he's gone  
Well that's all right  
Baby, I could walk you all the way home  
  
Baby, I could walk you all the way home

"Well I came by your house the other day, your mother said you went away  
She said there was nothing that I could have done  
There was nothing nobody could say  
Me and you weve known each other ever since we were sixteen  
I wished I would have known I wished I could have called you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their noise  
We liked the same music we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes  
We told each other that we were the wildest, the wildest things wed ever  
Seen  
Now I wished you would have told me I wished I could have talked to you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now we went walking in the rain talking about the pain from the world we hid  
Now there aint nobody nowhere nohow gonna ever understand me the way you did  
Maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere  
In some bus or train traveling along  
In some motel room therell be a radio playing  
And you'll hear me sing this song  
Well if you do you'll know I'm thinking of you and all the miles in between  
And I'm just calling one last time not to change your mind  
But just to say I miss you baby, good luck goodbye, bobby jean

"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream  
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines  
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,  
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line  
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back  
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap  
We gotta get out while we're young  
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run  
  
Yes, girl we were  
  
Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend  
I want to guard your dreams and visions  
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims  
And strap your hands 'cross my engines  
Together we could break this trap  
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back  
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire  
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider  
But I gotta know how it feels  
I want to know if love is wild  
Babe I want to know if love is real  
  
Oh, can you show me  
  
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard  
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors  
And the boys try to look so hard  
The amusement park rises bold and stark  
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist  
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight  
In an everlasting kiss  
  
One, two, three, four!  
  
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive  
Everybody's out on the run tonight  
But there's no place left to hide  
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness  
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul  
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when  
We're gonna get to that place  
Where we really wanna go  
And we'll walk in the sun  
But till then tramps like us  
Baby we were born to run  
  
Oh honey, tramps like us  
Baby we were born to run  
  
Come on Wendy, tramps like us  
Baby we were born to run

"As I was walking down the street  
Down the street, down the street  
A pretty girl I chanced to meet  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon  
  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And he knees was a-knockin' and her shoes was a'rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon  
  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And her knees was a-knockin' and her shoes was a-rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And we danced by the light of the moon

"Well there she sits buddy just a-gleaming in the sun  
There to greet a working man when his day is done  
I'm gonna pack my pa and I'm gonna pack my aunt  
I'm gonna take them down to the Cadillac ranch  
  
Eldorado fins, whitewalls and skirts  
Rides just like a little bit of heaven here on earth  
Well buddy when I die throw my body in the back  
And drive me to the junkyard in my Cadillac  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark shiny and black  
Open up your engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
James Dean in that mercury '49  
Junior Johnson runnin' through the woods of Carolina  
Even Burt Reynolds in that black Trans Am  
All gonna meet down at the Cadillac ranch  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight  
Drivin' alone through the Wisconsin night  
You're my last love you're my last chance  
Don't let 'em take me to the Cadillac ranch

"Well my name is Catherine LeFevre  
I work at the Astrowash on Sunset and Vine  
I drop my kids at school in the morning  
And I pick them up at Mary's just 'fore suppertime  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Well I work down at the car wash  
For a dollar and a dime  
And mister, I hate my boss  
It's at the car wash I'm doing my time  
Pick up my water bottle and my towel, sir  
And I take 'em one by one  
From Mercedes to V.W's  
I do 'em all and I don't favor none  
  
Well someday I'll sing in a night club  
I'll get a million-dollar break  
A handsome man will come here with a contract in his hand  
And say ""Catherine, this has all been some mistake""

"Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road  
He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code  
When something caught his eye he'd measure his need  
And then very carefully he'd proceed  
  
Billy met a young girl in the early days of May  
It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away  
In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim  
He'd lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him  
  
On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the
word fear  
And in which hand he held his fate was never clear  
Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride  
And with his own hands built a great house down by the riverside  
  
Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right  
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights  
Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray  
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay  
  
One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name  
She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep, a thousand miles away  
He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode  
When he got there he didn't find nothing but road  
  
Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name  
Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain  
At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on
her skin so white  
Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light

"
"A lovely, poignant song  
About a man fated to be kept apart from his true love  
  
""well, sometimes I dream of gettin' outta here,  
Headin' down towards them old tracks  
I swore I'd come and get her  
But I know I ain't never goin' back  
  
""there's nights I can't sleep  
No matter how hard I try  
So from my window I watch the moonlight  
Fall on the far hillside  
  
""I imagine I put on my jacket,  
Go down to this little roadside bar  
Pick a stranger and spin around the dance floor  
To a mexican guitar""

"
"Well, far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sound  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom crashing  
  
Yeah, flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight  
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night  
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well, in the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden here while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain  
Dissolved into the wild bales of lightning  
  
Yeah, tolling for the rebel, yeah, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaken  
Yeah tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Alright now  
  
And then through a cloud like curtain in a far off corner flashed  
As the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Well, electric light still struck like arrows  
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
  
Well, tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
And for each un-harmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well, starry-eyed and laughing, I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look  
Spellbound and swallowed as the tolling ended  
  
Yeah, tolling for the aching ones whose wounds  
Cannot be nursed for the countless confused  
Accused, misused, strung out ones and worse  
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
(Yeah)  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Alright, now, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Well, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Well, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Well, whoa, whoa, whoa

"Every year when summer comes around

You can feel somethin's happenin' in the air  
Well, from Carol's house up on Telegraph Hill  
You can see the lights going up out in Soldiers Field  
Getting ready, for the county fair  
  
County fair, county fair,  
Everybody in town'll be there  
So come on, hey we're goin' down there  
(hey) Little girl with the long blond hair  
Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears  
Baby, down at the country fair  
  
Now you'll be hangin' tight when we hit the top  
And that rollercoaster's ready to drop  
And your braggin', how you wasn't even scared

And they got a little rock and roll band  
People dancin' out in the open air  
It's James Young and the Immortal Ones  
Two guitars, (baby) bass and drums  
Just rockin', down at the county fair

We let that fortune wheel spin around  
Come on mister tell me what's waiting out there  
On my way out I steal a kiss in the dark  
Hope I can remember where our car's parked  
Baby, out at the county fair  
  
Now off down the highway there's the last stream of cars  
We sit a while in my front yard  
With the radio playin' soft and low  
I pull Carol close to my heart  
And I lean back and stare up at the stars  
Oh I wish, I'd never have to let this moment go

Through them spaces in between

And the sky gets black

Hell they don't know wrongs from their rights,

What was inside, man, was just see'est magnifique  
I wanted to hold the bumper and let her drag me down the street  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you  
Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you  
Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you tonight  
  
Sometimes I spot a little stranger standing 'cross the room  
My brain takes a vacation just to give my heart more room  
For one kiss, darling I swear everything I would give  
'Cause SHES A walking, talking reason to live  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Well now she might be the talk of high society  
She's probably got a lousy personality  
She might be a heiress to Rockefeller  
She might be a waitress or a bank teller  
She makes the Venus de Milo look like she's got no style  
She make Sheena of the Jungle look meek and mild  
I need a quick shot, Doc, knock me off my feet  
'Cause I'll be minding my own business walking down the street...watchout!  
  
[Chorus:]

"Cynthia, when you come walkin' by you're an inspiring sight  
Cynthia, you don't smile or say hi but baby that's alright  
'Cause I don't need to hold you or taste your kiss  
I just like knowin', Cynthia, you exist  
in a world like this  
  
Cynthia, when you pass it seems like this whole town drops  
Cynthia, or maybe it's just me, baby, and these fools stuck here punchin' this
clock  
Well you give us a reason to stop just for a while  
Stop, stand and salute your style  
  
Well now you ain't the finest thing I'll never have  
And when you go the hurt you leave, baby, it ain't so bad  
There ain't a man in this whole town who'd say you ain't fine  
You hear them guys talkin', tell me baby do you mind  
Well you make us happy, honey, when we feel sad  
To see something so good in a world gone bad  
There's still Cynthia  
  
Cynthia, no one knows your number, no one knows where you live  
Cynthia, I wonder do you understand this strange thing you give  
Well baby is it your style, the mystery in your smile  
Or just how cool you walk in a world gone wild  
Tell me if you will, Cynthia  
  
Well I gotta be pretty naive to believe in you  
I know you ain't ever gonna be my dream come true  
That's alright, I got other dreams as good as you, Cynthia  
Yeah now baby, now this ain't no come-on  
Just walk on, Cynthia, walk on  
You make me holler, yeah, yeah, alright  
I said yeah, yeah, alright  
Well she's a yeah, yeah, alright  
I said yeah, yeah, alright

"Driving in to darlington county  
Me and wayne on the fourth of july  
Driving in to darlington county  
Looking for some work on the county line  
We drove down from new york city  
Where the girls are pretty but they just want to know your name  
Driving in to darlington city  
Got a union connection with an uncle of waynes  
We drove eight hundred miles without seeing a cop  
We got rock and roll music blasting off the t-top singing  
  
Sha la la la la la la la la, sha la la la la la la  
  
Hey little girl standing on the corner  
Todays your lucky day for sure all right  
Me and my buddy were from new york city  
We got two hundred dollars we want to rock all night  
Girl you're looking at two big spenders  
Why the world don't know what me and wayne might do  
Our pas each own one of the world trade centers  
For a kiss and a smile I'll give mine all to you  
Come on baby take a seat on my fender  
Its a long night and tell me what else were you gonna do  
Just me and you we could

Little girl sitting in the window  
Aint seen my buddy in seven days  
County man tells me the same thing

Little girl you're so young and pretty  
Walk with me and you can have your way  
And well leave this darlington city  
For a ride down that dixie highway

Driving out of darlington county  
Seen wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a state troopers ford

"Well ever since you were a little girl  
You set the rules in your little world  
But girls grow up and throw their toys away  
You're a big girl now but you still wanna play  
(Girl we're living)  
You dress them up the way you want to  
(Girl we're living)  
You make them do just what you want them to  
(Girl we're living)  
Once I thought we had a love that was true  
But I'm just another doll in your dollhouse to you  
  
We're living in a dollhouse  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl we're living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
  
It's all been neatly arranged in your mind  
Every detail fits your own design  
Every room is perfectly in place  
But I can see the sadness, baby, on your face  
You had a plan and darling like a child  
You thought it's down to fashion, down to style  
But your little dreamhouse is runnin' wild  
Before your very eyes we're shrinking down to size  
  
We're living in a dollhouse  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl we're living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
  
Everything's as you dreamed it would be  
But there's something wrong that you can't see  
Room by room you keep looking for some little flaw  
A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall  
Something, girl, that will explain away  
The hurt you feel, darling, when we play  
  
Your little dolls they got grip on you  
Until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse  
Oh we're living in a dollhouse  
We may feel safe and sound  
But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
Oh we're living in a dollhouse  
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse  
Yeah we're living in a dollhouse

"I had a job, I had a girl  
I had something going, mister, in this world  
I got laid off down at the lumber yard  
Our love went bad, times got hard  
Now I work down at the car wash  
Where all it ever does is rain  
Don't you feel like you're a rider on a downbound train  
  
She just said, ""Joe, I gotta go  
We had it once, we ain't got it anymore""  
She packed her bags, left me behind  
She bought a ticket on the Central Line  
Nights as I sleep, I hear that whistle whining  
I feel her kiss in the misty rain  
And I feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train  
  
Last night I heard your voice  
You were crying, crying, you were so alone  
You said your love had never died  
You were waiting for me at home  
Put on my jacket, I ran through the woods  
I ran till I thought my chest would explode  
There in the clearing, beyond the highway  
In the moonlight, our wedding house shone  
I rushed through the yard  
I burst through the front door, my head pounding hard  
Up the stairs I climbed  
The room was dark, our bed was empty  
Then I heard that long whistle whine  
And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried  
Now I swing a sledge hammer on a railroad gang  
Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain  
Now, don't it feel like you're a rider on a downbound train

"
"I woke up this morning  
I could barely breathe  
Just an empty impression  
In the bed there you used to be  
I want a kiss from your lips  
I want an eye for an eye  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
  
Blood on the streets  
Blood flowin' down  
I hear the blood of my blood  
Cryin' from the ground  
  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
  
On the plains of Jordan  
I cut my bow from the wood  
Of this tree of evil  
Of this tree of good  
I want a kiss from your lips  
I want an eye for an eye  
I woke up this morning to the empty sky

"It was on the day the cowboys were abandoned from the ranch  
Middle touch world as a master  
They rode their ponies down in the cities of gold  
To leave them for ever after  
Now the sun was swollen red and old  
The earth it was windy, dark and cold  
Were the highway ends the desert takes its toll  
Sodusty, red and angry  
It was a time when men died out on the praire  
From not having a decent friend  
At nights the ghosts to the more of riders  
Was a howl in the candid winds  
  
You can here them crying  
Good god, I think they're dying  
  
When them rangers down in dallas  
Had all, but given it up and left  
And those that hang on hoping  
Was trying their best to, to forget  
The way those outlaws and desperadoes  
Right from the cheapest to the best  
Rode in on ponies made of skin and bones  
Keep up their rusty guns and went back home  
And the governor was sent down from population control  
And marshall all was past  
Riverboat gamblers put their money on faith  
For the time for hope they passed  
  
In the cold blue light of the desert night  
There was a thousand starry ships  
And men came down from still I don't now where  
With death on their fingertips  
Now there's no more kings in texas  
I swear they rounded up each and everyone  
And old atlanta canastoga  
Reached from the rocky mountains into the old dead sun  
Now anna maria walks the blames alone  
The last of a struggling people  
She thinks of all those outlaws who wanted to reach for the skies  
And got stuck up on a steamboat  
Oh, you can hear them crying  
Good god, I think they're dying  
In the wind you can hear them sighing

"Early in the morning factory whistle blows,  
Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes,  
Man takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light,  
It's the working, the working, just the working life.  
  
Through the mansions of fear, through the mansions of pain,  
I see my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain,  
Factory takes his hearing, factory gives him life,  
The working, the working, just the working life.  
  
End of the day, factory whistle cries,  
Men walk through these gates with death in their eyes.  
And you just better believe, boy,  
Somebody's gonna get hurt tonight,  
It's the working, the working, just the working life.

"Well now you say you've found another man who does things to you that I can't  
And that no matter what I do it's all over now  
Between me and you girl  
But I can't believe what you say  
No I can't believe what you say  
'Cause baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't want to fade away  
Oh I don't want to fade away  
Tell me what can I do what can I say  
'Cause darlin' I don't want to fade away  
  
Well now you say that you've made up your mind  
It's been such a long, long time since it's been good with us  
And that somewhere back along the line you lost your love and I lost your
trust  
Now rooms that once were so bright are filled with the coming night, darlin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You say it's not easy for you  
And that you've been so lonely  
While other girls go out doing what they want to do  
You say that you miss the nights whe we'd go out dancing  
The days when you and I walked as two  
Well girl, I miss them too  
Oh I swear that I do  
Oh girl  
  
Now baby I don't want to be just another useless memory holding you tight  
Or just some other ghost out on the street to whom you stop and politely speak  
When you pass on by vanishing into the night  
Left to vanish into the night  
No baby

"Well ya know when you're young,  
There's such a distance between you and your family.  
Just can't see things from the same point of view.  
  
Papa wants a lawyer and mama she wants an author,  
And all you want is for them to want you.  
  
Well, I saw lot of bad signs and we had some real bad timesback on the east
coast.  
And I guess you could say it took california to bring us close.  
There was a lot of hard livin' and some stone cold women on the east coast.  
And I saw my papa turn away when I need him the most.  
And california, she's an angel.  
Lo, so heavenly dressed  
And the pacific she's a woman  
The lord must have loved her best.  
I got a california rainbow to come give them thunder clouds a rest  
And the mountain is my friend now, she put me to her test  
Well you know every father has dreams and schemes for his own kid.  
And dreaming it ain't been declaired no capital crime  
But I just hope when I grow up to have my own kids  
I'll love them all I can and let 'em make their own minds  
Now you know how a mother can hold the son through understanding.  
And my father he once held me close by crying.  
Whoa, and my mama's love it don't ever leave me standing.  
And papa's love it just leaves me smiling.  
Whoa, and my mama she's a rainbow,  
Gotta see hen on sunday when she's dressed  
Whoa, and my papa he's a good man, he gives me and mama his best.  
Whoa, my mama she's a rainbow, come to give them thunder clouds a rest.  
And my family is my friend now california put us through her test.

"
"I'm driving in my car, I turn on the radio  
I'm pulling you close, you just say no  
You say you don't like it, but girl I know you're a liar  
'Cause when we kiss, fire  
  
Late at night I'm takin' you home  
I say I want to stay, you say you want to be alone  
You say you don't love me, girl you can't hide your desire  
'Cause when we kiss, fire  
  
You had a hold on me, right from the start  
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart  
My nerves all jumpin' actin' like a fool  
Well your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool  
  
Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah  
You can bet their love they didn't deny  
Your words say split but your words they lie  
'Cause when we kiss, fire

"Dark weekends in the sun out on Chelsea Road  
Descending the stairs, Frankie, my one  
Check your makeup in the mirror c'mon babe let's go  
We'll dance 'round this dirty town 'til the night is all done  
Let all the finer things sleep alone tonight  
Let all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight  
Don't worry about us, baby, we'll be alright  
  
Well everybody's dying, this town's closing down  
They're all sittin' down at the courthouse waiting for 'em to take the flag
down  
I see strange flashes in the sky up above  
Gonna spend the night at the drive-in with the one that I love  
At dusk the stars all appear on the screen  
Yeah, just like they do each night in my dreams  
But tonight's no dream, Frankie, I can feel myself too  
Well now and forever my love is for you  
  
Walk softly tonight little stranger  
Yeah into these shadows we're passing through  
Talk softly tonight, little angel  
You make all my dream worlds come true  
  
Well lately I've been standing out in the freezing rain  
Readin' them want ads out on Chelsea Road  
I'm winging down the street in search of new games  
Hustling through these nightlights' diamond glow  
Well Frankie I don't know what I'm gonna find  
Maybe nothing at all, maybe a world I can call mine  
Shining like these streetlights down here on the strand  
Bright as the rain in the palm of your hand  
  
Walk softly tonight, little stranger  
Into the shadows where lovers go  
Talk softly to me, little angel  
Whisper your secrets so soft and low

Well, Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat sides  
To think his niece would be a bride  
  
Well, Uncle Rat rode off to town  
To buy his niece a wedding gown  
  
Where will the wedding supper be  
Way down yonder in a hollow tree  
  
What will the wedding supper be  
A fried misquito and a roasted flea  
  
First to come in were to little ants  
Fixing around to have a dance  
  
Next to come in was a bumble bee  
Bouncing a fiddle on his knee  
  
Next to come in was a fat sassy lad  
Thinks himself as big as his dad  
  
Thinks himself a man indeed  
Because he chews the tobacco weed  
  
And next to come in was a big tomcat  
He swallowed the frog and the mouse and the rat

"Fifteen years Le Bing Son  
Fought side by side with the Americans  
In the mountains and deltas of Vietnam  
  
In '75 Saigon fell  
And he left his command  
And brought his family to the promised land  
  
Seabrook Texas and the small towns  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
It was delta country and reminded him of home  
  
He worked as a machinist, put his money away  
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin  
And together they harvested Galveston Bay  
  
In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up  
He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter  
Steer out through the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company  
In the highlands of Quang Tri  
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai  
And shipped home in '68  
  
There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds  
In a boat that'd been his father's  
In the morning he'd kiss his sleeping son  
And cast his nets into the water  
  
Billy sat in front of his TV as the south fell  
And the Communists rolled into Saigon  
He and his friends watched as the refugees came  
Settle on the same streets and worked the coast they grew up on  
  
Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk  
Of America for Americans  
Someone said, ""You want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out""  
And brought in the Texas klan  
  
One humid Texas night there were three shadows on the harbor  
Come to burn the Vietnamese boats into the sea  
In the fire's light shots rang out  
Two Texans lay dead on the ground  
Le stood with a pistol in his hand  
  
A jury acquitted him in self defense  
As before the judge he did stand  
But as he walked down the courthouse steps  
Billy said ""My friend, you're a dead man""  
  
One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside  
Billy stood in the shadows  
His K-bar knife in his hand  
And the moon slipped behind the clouds  
  
Le lit a cigarette, the bay was as still as glass  
As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket  
Took a breath and let him pass  
  
In the early darkness Billy rose up  
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water  
Kissed his sleeping wife  
Headed into the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Of Galveston Bay

"I had a friend was a big baseball player  
Back in high school  
He could throw that speedball by you  
Make you look like a fool boy  
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar  
I was walking in, he was walking out  
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks  
But all he kept talking about was  
  
Glory days well they'll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days  
  
Well there's a girl that lives up the block  
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads  
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by  
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed  
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up  
I guess it's two years gone by now  
We just sit around talking about the old times,  
She says when she feels like crying  
She starts laughing thinking about  
  
Glory days well they'll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days  
  
Think I'm going down to the well tonight  
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill  
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it  
But I probably will  
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture  
A little of the glory, well time slips away  
And leaves you with nothing mister but  
Boring stories of  
  
Glory days yeah they'll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days  
  
Yeah they'll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days

There's good rockin' tonight.  
Have you heard the news?

"I stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade  
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade  
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch  
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul  
Untouched  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said 'Sit down' I stood
up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up  
The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing  
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could
sing  
I pushed B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on
standing  
I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to
landing  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said 'Come down' I threw
up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up  
  
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard
to hold your breath  
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid  
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little  
Place in the stars  
I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said 'Sit down' I stood
up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up

"
"From nowhere through the caravan  
Round the campfire light  
Lovely woman in motion  
With hair as dark as night  
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark  
That hypnotized me with love  
  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She danced around and round  
  
Guitar's melody  
From the fire her face was aglow  
How she enchanted me  
I'd like to hold her near  
And kiss her hair and whisper in her ear  
  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
  
All through the caravan  
She was dancing with all the men  
Waiting for the rising sun  
Everyone was having fun  
Hated to see her go  
Knowing that she'll never know  
That I love her  
That I love her  
  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman

"Some need gold and some need diamond rings  
Or a drug to take away the pain that living brings  
A promise of a better world to come  
When whatever here is done  
I don't need that sky of blue  
All I know's since I found you, I'm happy when I'm in your arms  
Happy, darling, come the dark  
Happy when I taste your kiss  
I'm happy in a love like this  
  
There's a house upon a distant hill  
Where you can hear the laughter of children ring  
Guardian angels, they watch from above  
Watching over the love that they bring  
But at night I feel the darkness near, I awake and I find you near  
I'm happy with you in my arms  
I'm happy with you in my heart  
Happy when I taste your kiss  
I'm happy in love like this  
  
In a world of doubt and fear  
I wake at night and reach to find you near  
Lost in a dream, you caught me as I fell  
I want more than just a dream to tell  
  
We're born in this world, darling, with few days and trouble never far behind  
Man and woman circle each other in a cage  
A cage that's been handed down the line  
Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars  
Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars  
Happy in each other's arms  
Happy, baby, come the dark  
Happy in each other's kiss  
I'm happy in a love like this

"My name is Joe Roberts I work for the state  
I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville barracks number eight  
I always done an honest job as honest as I could  
I got a brother named Frankie and Frankie ain't no good  
  
Now ever since we was young kids it's been the same come down  
I get a call over the radio Frankie's in trouble downtown  
Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away  
But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way  
  
Yeah me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin'  
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band  
Played ""Night of the Johnstown Flood""  
  
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother would  
Man turns his back on his family well he just ain't no good  
  
Well Frankie went in the army back in 1965  
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife  
But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we were gettin'  
Robbed  
Frankie came home in '68, and me, I took this job  
  
Yeah we're laughin' and drinkin'  
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band  
Played ""Night of the Johnstown Flood""  
  
I catch him when he's strayin' teach him how to walk that line  
Man turns his back on his family he ain't no friend of mine  
  
Well the night was like any other, I got a call 'bout quarter to nine  
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line  
There was a kid lyin' on the floor lookin' bad bleedin' hard from his head  
There was a girl cry'n' at a table and it was Frank, they said  
  
Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights  
Well I musta done one hundred and ten through Michigan county that night  
It was out at the crossroads, down 'round Willow bank  
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates. Behind the wheel was Frank  
  
Well I chased him through them county roads  
Till a sign said ""Canadian border five miles from here""  
I pulled over the side of the highway and watched his tail-lights disappear  
  
Me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin'  
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band  
Played ""Night of the Johnstown Flood""

"You and me we were the pretenders  
We let it all slip away  
In the end what you don't surrender  
Well the world just strips away  
  
Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers  
Ain't gonna find no miracles here  
Well you can wait on your blesses my darlin'  
I got a deal for you right here  
  
I ain't lookin' for praise or pity  
I ain't comin' 'round searchin' for a crutch  
I just want someone to talk to  
And a little of that human touch  
Just a little of that human touch  
  
Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town  
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies  
Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood  
It's just you and me tonight  
  
Tell me, in a world without pity  
Do you think what I'm askin's too much  
I just want something to hold on to  
And a little of that human touch  
Just a little of that human touch  
  
Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize  
Well it comes at a hard hard price  
You can't shut off the risk and the pain  
Without losin' the love that remains  
We're all riders on this train  
  
So you've been broken and you've been hurt  
Show me somebody who ain't  
Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain  
But, hell, a little touchup  
And a little paint  
  
You might need somethin' to hold on to  
When all the answers, they don't amount to much  
Somebody that you could just to talk to  
And a little of that human touch  
  
Baby, in a world without pity  
Do you think what I'm askin's too much  
I just want to feel you in my arms  
Share a little of that human touch  
Share a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Share a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Give me a little of that human touch  
Give me a little of that human touch

"I hauled myself up out of a ditch  
I built me an ark out of gopher wood and pitch  
Sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Well I woke last night to the heavy clicking and clack  
And a scarecrow on fire along the railroad tracks  
There were empty cities and burning plains  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
We all come up a little short and we go down hard  
These days I spend my time skipping through the dark  
Through the empires of dust I chant your name  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Through the bone yard we rattled and black smoke we rolled on  
Down into the valley where the beast has his throne  
I sing my song and I sharpen my blade  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Strength is vanity and time is illusion  
I feel you breathing, the rest is confusion  
Your skin touches mine, what else to explain  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Now pray for yourself and that you may not fall  
When the hour of deliverance comes on us all  
When high hope and faith and courage and trust  
Can rise or vanish like dust and dust  
Now there's a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed  
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game  
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game  
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game

"It's the end of another working day  
Come on and pack your blues away  
Change your clothes, we'll go for a ride  
To the other side  
  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
  
Over here it's easier to breathe  
There's a place for you and me  
And there's no devil here to pay  
And come the light of day we pray  
  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
  
And together we'll ride the other side  
We'll feel so free, just you and me  
And I'll pray what is due  
Till the night sees us through  
  
And together we'll ride the other side  
We'll feel so free, just you and me  
When this long is day is through  
We will dance in blue

Come and pack your blues away

"Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night  
With bruised arms and broken rhythm and a beat-up old Buick but dressed just
like dynamite  
He tried sellin' his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street  
But they said, ""Johnny, it falls apart so easily, and you know hearts these
days are cheap""  
And the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a cheater""  
And the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a liar""  
And from out of the shadows came a young girl's voice, said, ""Johnny, don't
cry""  
Puerto Rican Jane, oh, won't you tell me, what's your name?  
I want to drive you down to the other side of town  
Where paradise ain't so crowded and there'll be action goin' down on Shanty
Lane tonight  
All the golden-heeled fairies in a real bitch-fight  
Pull .38's and kiss their girls goodnight  
  
Goodnight, it's alright, Jane  
Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame  
We may find it out on the street tonight, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe  
  
Well, like a cool Romeo he made his moves, oh, she looked so fine  
Like a late Juliet, she knew she'd never be true but then, she really didn't
mind  
Upstairs a band was playin' and the singer was singin' something about going
home  
She whispered, ""Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight, but just don't leave
me alone""  
And Johnny cried, ""Puerto Rican Jane, word is down, the cops have found the
vein""  
Them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods  
Them little barefoot street boys, they said their homes ain't no good  
They left the corners, threw away their switchblade knives and kissed each
other goodbye  
  
Johnny was sittin' on the fire escape, watchin' the kids playin' down the
street  
He called down, ""Hey little heroes, summer's long, but I guess it ain't very
sweet around here anymore""  
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat  
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on  
And the sister prays for lost souls, then breaks down in the chapel after
everyone's gone  
  
Jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see Johnny up and
putting his clothes on  
She says, ""Those romantic young boys, all they ever want to do is fight  
Those romantic young boys, they're callin' through the window  
Hey, Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?""  
  
And Johnny whispered, ""Goodnight, it's all tight, Jane  
I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane  
We may find it out on the street tonight, now, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe""  
Goodnight, it's alright, Jane  
I'm gonna meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane  
We can find it out on the street tonight, now, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe

"The sky was falling and streaked with blood  
I heard you calling me then you disappeared into the dust  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
I need your kiss, but love and duty called you someplace higher  
Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love give us love  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love bring us love  
  
You gave your love to see, in fields of red and autumn brown  
You gave your love to me and lay your young body down  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
I need you near, but love and duty called you someplace higher  
Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love give us love  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love bring us love  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love bring us love  
  
It was dark, too dark to see, you held me in the light you gave  
You lay your hand on me  
Then walked into the darkness of your smoky grave  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
I need your kiss, but love and duty called you someplace higher  
Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love bring us love...  
  
May your love bring us love

"I'll mow your lawn, clean the leaves out your drain  
I'll mend your roof to keep out the rain  
I'll take the work that God provides  
I'm a Jack of all trades, honey, we'll be alright  
  
I'll hammer the nails, and I'll set the stone  
I'll harvest your crops when they're ripe and grown  
I'll pull that engine apart and patch her up 'til she's running right  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
  
A hurricane blows, brings a hard rain  
When the blue sky breaks, feels like the world's gonna change  
We'll start caring for each other like Jesus said that we might  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
  
The banker man grows fatter, the working man grows thin  
It's all happened before and it'll happen again  
It'll happen again, they'll bet your life  
I'm a Jack of all trades and, darling, we'll be alright  
  
Now sometimes tomorrow comes soaked in treasure and blood  
Here we stood the drought, now we'll stand the flood  
There's a new world coming, I can see the light  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
  
So you use what you've got, and you learn to make do  
You take the old, you make it new  
If I had me a gun, I'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright

Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart

You come home late and get undressed  
You lie in bed and feel this emptiness  
Well listen to me  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Till every river it runs dry  
Until the sun's torn from the sky  
Till every feel you've felt burst free  
Gone tumblin' down into the sea  
Listen to me  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart

"Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month  
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none  
He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine  
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99  
  
Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop  
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top  
When an off-duty cop snuck up on him from behind  
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99  
  
Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown  
He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down  
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime  
Prison for ninety eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99  
A fist fight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away  
His mama stood up and shouted ""Judge don't take my boy this way""  
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make  
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away  
  
Now judge I had debts no honest man could pay  
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away  
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man  
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand  
  
Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead  
So if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head  
Then sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time  
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that killin' line

"The Rangers had a homecoming  
In Harlem late last night  
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine  
Over the Jersey state line  
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge  
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain  
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants  
Together they take a stab at romance  
And disappear down Flamingo Lane  
  
Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo  
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl  
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows  
Always quiet, holding hands  
From the churches to the jails  
Tonight all is silence in the world  
As we take our stand  
Down in Jungleland  
  
The midnight gang's assembled  
And picked a rendezvous for the night  
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign  
That brings this fair city light  
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike  
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley  
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night  
The street's alive as secret debts are paid  
Contacts made, they flash unseen  
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades  
Hustling for the record machine  
The hungry and the hunted  
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands  
That face off against each other out in the street  
Down in Jungleland  
  
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage  
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays  
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners  
Desperate as the night moves on  
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone  
  
Beneath the city, two hearts beat  
Soul engines running through a night so tender  
In a bedroom locked in whispers  
Of soft refusal and then surrender  
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down  
As shots echo down them hallways in the night  
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away  
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light  
  
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz  
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy  
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all  
They just stand back and let it all be  
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment  
And try to make an honest stand  
But they wind up wounded, not even dead  
Tonight in Jungleland

"We took the highway till the road went black  
We marked Truth Or Consequences on our map  
A voice drifted up from the radio  
We saw the voice from long ago  
  
[Chorus]  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
  
The kids asleep in the backseat  
We're just countin' the miles you and me  
We don't measure the blood we've drawn anymore  
We just stack the bodies outside the door  
  
The wise men were all fools  
What to do  
  
The sun sets in flames as the city burns  
Another day gone down as the night turns  
And I hold you here in my heart  
As things fall apart  
  
A downtown window flushed with light  
Faces of the dead at five (faces of the dead at five)  
A martyr's silent eyes  
Petition the drivers as we pass by  
  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break  
Who'll be the last to die  
  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Darlin' your tyrants and kings form the same fate  
Strung up at your city gates  
And you're the last to die for a mistake

"When I asked you if everything is alright  
You whisper ""Don't worry"" and you shut out the light  
Now black is black in this bed we're laying  
And I want to believe the words that you're saying  
  
[Chorus]  
But your eyes look like a leavin' train  
They keep on dragging me down  
Your eyes look like a leavin' train  
They keep on draggin'  
They keep on draggin'  
They keep on draggin' me down  
  
Well I did anything just to try to get close to you  
I took it step by step like a man's supposed to  
Tell me now, is this my  
Is this my contrition  
To have the love that I longed for fill me with suspicion  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it's tellin' time, oh my little sister  
Now can I believe the words, the words of love you whisper  
Is my train in vain, has my soul gone to waste  
Am I just a victim of, a victim of my lost faith  
  
[Chorus]

"
"We met down in the valley, where the wine of love and destruction flows  
There in that curve of darkness where flowers of temptation grow  
I left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else  
You felt so good to me baby, as good as life itself  
  
You were life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
I knew you were in trouble, anyone could tell  
You carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell  
You squandered all your riches, your love, your beauty and your wealth  
Like you had no further use for, for life itself  
  
You were life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
Why the things that we treasure most slip away in time  
'Til to the music we grow deaf and to god's beauty blind  
Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart  
'Til we fall away in our own darkness, stranger to our own hearts  
  
And to life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
So here's one for the road  
Here's one to your health  
And to life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
Life itself  
Life itself  
Life itself  
Life itself

"The midnight boys are outside  
Scraping tears up off the street  
Standin' guard beneath the window  
Where only Linda sleeps  
The leader is a kid named Eddie  
Walkin' like an angel in defeat  
He trashes her old man's car, slashes Linda's name in the street  
And calls out  
  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
  
In a room full of contenders  
Eddy spars 'til he drops to his bed and surrenders Draped in the scarves  
He stole from Linda's bedroom  
The night he laid at her feet  
When the midnight boys were stranded  
Down on Cason Street  
  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one

Eddy hides from the rain  
In with the stolen sisters 'til the streets are dry again  
Talkin' fast cars and spare parts  
Empty homes and hearts  
Distant worlds with strange girls  
And kneeling with Linda in the dark  
  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one

"I got lumps in my throat  
When I saw her comin down the aisle  
I got the wiggles in my knees  
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled  
Well there she is again  
Standin over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But she's too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
  
Meanwhile I was thinkin'  
  
Well if she's in the mood  
No need to break it  
I got the chance and I oughta take it  
If she can dance we can make it  
C'mon queenie let's shake it  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
Won't someone tell me  
Who's the queen standin over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But she's too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
Meanwhile, I was still thinkin, hmmmm,  
Well if it's a slow one  
We'll omit it  
If it's a rocker, then we'll get it  
If it's a good one, she'll admit it  
C'mon queenie, let's get with it  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie...

"A letter come blowin' in  
On an ill wind  
Somethin' 'bout me and you  
Never seein' one another again  
  
And what I knew had come  
Stars struck deaf and dumb  
Like when we kissed  
That taste of blood on your tongue  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Don't worry, darlin'  
No baby, don't you fret  
We're livin' in the future  
And none of this has happened yet  
  
Woke up election day  
Sky's gunpowder and shades of grey  
Beneath the dirty sun  
I whistle my time away  
  
Then just about sun down  
You come walkin' through town  
Your boot heels clickin' like  
The barrel of a pistol spinnin' round  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The earth it gave away  
The sea rose towards the sun  
I opened up my heart to you  
It got all damaged and undone  
  
My ship Liberty sailed away  
On a bloody red horizon  
The grounds keeper opened the gates  
And let the wild dogs run  
  
Alone I limp through town  
A lost cowboy at sundown  
Got my monkey on a leash  
Got my ear tuned to the ground  
  
My faith's been torn asunder  
Tell me is that rollin' thunder  
Or just the sinkin' sound  
Of somethin' righteous goin' under  
  
[Chorus]  
  
None of this has happened yet  
None of this has happened yet  
None of this has happened yet  
None of this has happened yet  
  
Na na na na, na na na na-na [Repeat until fade]

"Live performance  
Well, I dreamed I was a gypsy riding the land  
With a tambourine and a gypsy queen  
And a rainbow caravan  
Happy old land sailor, yeah, that's what I want to be  
Stealing diamonds from the rich men to throw in the sea  
Singing look toward the land  
'cause the land holds the key  
Keep an eye on the land  
And an eye on man  
  
Well, I dreamed I was a cabin boy  
On an American Clipper line  
Watering flowers for the captain  
That they may not wilt  
Bringing cargo to colonies of South Caroline  
On the best ol' Clipper Dave Mckay ever built  
  
Singing look toward the land  
'cause the land is the key  
Singing keep an eye on the land  
And an eye on the sea  
  
Well, I dreamed I was your lover  
'Cause that's what I want to be  
And I dreamed that every night you dreamed only of me  
And we walked along the beach, and ooh, we held hands  
And I told you you were my only woman  
And I was your only man  
  
Singing look toward the lovers  
For they are the key  
Keep an eye on the lovers  
And an eye on the war machine  
  
Yes I dreamed I was a captain of a river queen  
Caressing Mississippi waters down to New Orleans  
Yeah, a happy ol' riverboat captain, that's what I'd like to be  
And I'd let you ride my honey, I'd let you ride her for free  
  
Singing look toward the river  
'Cause the river's the key  
Keep an eye on the river  
And an eye on the sea  
  
Well, I dreamed I was your friend  
'Cause that's what I want to be  
And every night, you had dreams  
And they were all of me  
We'd walk all the streets together  
Hand in hand  
And be kind to the women  
And the women be kind to the me

"Met her at a friendly little bar down along the coast  
She said it was her birthday so we had us a nice little toast  
Drove around for a while, smoked a few cigarettes  
Took her back to my place, she slipped off her party dress  
She sat for a while on the edge of the bed just talkin'  
Loose change in my pocket  
Loose change in my pocket  
  
Pint of gin in my boot cuff, I'm drivin' for a drink and a dance  
Sittin' on the next stool, miss a little time on her hands  
Yeah I knew she was trouble, but trouble sure was lookin' fine  
And when I pulled her close what I knew kinda slipped my mind  
We lay in bed and watched the moon come up crawling  
Loose change in my pocket  
Loose change in my pocket  
  
I pour another drink, wait for the night to get through  
Stars are burning in that black void so far away and blue  
  
Now I'm sittin' at a red light I feel somethin' tickin' way down  
The night's moving like a slow train crawling through this shithole town  
Got my bags packed in the back and I'm tryin' to get going again  
But red just goes to green and green goes red and then  
Then all I hear's the clock on the dash tick-tocking  
Loose change in my pocket  
Loose change in my pocket

"My name is frank davis, drive up Dixie 109  
I was out on Highway 17, just south of the camden line  
It was down there in heart of Wilsonville, where I met my fate  
She was standing outside a barroom, said she was waitin' for a date  
but I knew that was just a line  
And I knew I was messin' with the losin' kind  
  
well I knew what we were both doin', and I knew that u cant win  
But when the light turned green, I reached across the seat,popped the lock and
she slid in,  
She said she liked Mexican music, she knew a place if I had the time  
So we had a few drinks and we danced for a while,I pulled her close, she didnt
mind  
And what I knew kinda slipped my mind,  
And I couldnt resist her kiss, with the losin' kind  
  
Well we drove around in my Buick, getting drunk and having fun  
We ended up at the Best Western, out on Highway 101  
It was around 3:00a.m., we went out, to this empty little roadside bar  
It was there the cash register was open, it was there I hit that guy real hard  
But I knew, when I hit him, for a second time,  
that one attracts the other, when there the losin' kind  
  
Well I grabbed her hand to get out of there, then I felt like I was gonna be
sick  
About a half hour later the sleet started comin' down,

"Each year many die crossing the deserts, mountains, and rivers of our southern
border in search of a better life. Here I follow the journey backwards, from
the body at the river bottom, to the man walking across the desert towards the
banks of the Rio Grande.  
  
For two days the river keeps you down  
Then you rise to the light without a sound  
Past the playgrounds and empty switching yards  
The turtles eat the skin from your eyes, so they lay open to the stars  
  
Your clothes give way to the current and river stone  
'Till every trace of who you ever were is gone  
And the things of the earth they make their claim  
That the things of heaven may do the same  
Goodbye, my darling, for your love I give God thanks,  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks  
  
Over rivers of stone and ancient ocean beds  
I walk on sandals of twine and tire tread  
My pockets full of dust, my mouth filled with cool stone  
The pale moon opens the earth to its bones  
I long, my darling, for your kiss, for your sweet love I give God thanks  
The touch of your loving fingertips  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks  
  
Your sweet memory comes on the evenin' wind  
I sleep and dream of holding you in my arms again  
The lights of Brownsville, across the river shine  
A shout rings out and into the silty red river I dive  
I long, my darling, for your kiss, for your sweet love I give God thanks  
A touch of your loving fingertips  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks  
  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks

"I bought a bourgeois house in the hollywood hills  
With a truckload of hundred thousand dollar bills  
Man came by to hook up my cable tv  
We settled in for the night my baby and me  
We switched 'round and 'round 'til half-past dawn  
There was fifty-seven channels and nothin' on  
  
Well now home entertainment was my baby's wish  
So I hopped into town for a satellite dish  
I tied it to the top of my japanese car  
I came home and I pointed it out into the stars  
A message came back from the great beyond  
There's fifty-seven channels and nothin' on  
  
Well we might'a made some friends with some billionaires  
We might'a got all nice and friendly if we'd made it upstairs  
All I got was a note that said "" bye-bye john  
Our love is fifty-seven channels and nothin' on""  
  
So I bought A. 44 magnum it was solid steel cast  
And in the blessed name of elvis well I just let it blast  
'til my tv lay in pieces there at my feet  
And they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace  
Judge said "" what you got in your defense son?""  
"" fifty-seven channels and nothin' on""  
  
I can see by your eyes friend you're just about gone  
Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on...

"It's cloudy out in Pittsburgh  
It's rainin' in Saigon  
Snow's fallin' all across the Michigan line  
Well she sits by the light of her Christmas tree  
With the radio softly on  
Thinkin' how a good man is so hard to find  
  
Well once she had a fella  
Once she was somebody's girl  
And she gave all she had that one last time  
Now there's a little girl asleep in the back room  
She's gonna have to tell about the meanness in this world  
And how a good man is so hard to find  
  
Well there's pictures on the table by her bed  
Him in his dress greens and her in her wedding white  
She remembers how the world was the day he left  
And now how that world is dead  
And a good man is so hard to find  
  
She got no time now for Casanovas  
Yeah those days are gone  
She don't want that anymore, she's made up her mind  
Just somebody to hold her  
As the night gets on  
When a good man is so hard to find  
  
Well she shuts off the TV  
And without a word  
Into bed she climbs  
Well she thinks how it was all so wasted  
And how expendable their dreams all were  
When a good man was so hard to find  
Well it's cloudy out in Pittsburgh...

"In the summer that I was baptized my father held me to his side  
As they put me to the water he said how on that day I cried  
We were prisoners of love a love in chains  
He was standin' in the door I was standin' in the rain  
With the same hot blood burning in our veins  
Adam raised a Cain  
All of the old faces ask you why you're back  
They fit you with position and the keys to your daddy's Cadillac  
In the darkness of your room your mother calls you by your true name  
You remember the faces the places the names  
You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain  
Adam raised a Cain  
  
In the Bible Cain slew Abel and East of Eden he was cast  
You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past  
  
Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain  
Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame  
You inherit the sins you inherit the flames  
Adam raised a Cain  
Lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream  
Adam raised a Cain

I remember last summer drifting through our eyes  
We're in the high grass, my finger in your hemline  
Boot heels click clacking, honey, when you shine  
All them blue skies, ?  
American beauty wherever you'd sigh  
Out on this highway counting white lines  
  
Your hand cups your breast pledging your time  
The things we carried, shining skylines  
Falling sparrow, sky torn apart  
Dark shining arrow, your kiss pierces my heart  
American beauty forever mine  
Out on this highway counting white lines

"They say the joint was rockin'  
A goin' 'round and round  
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound  
Well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down  
  
Oh it sounds so sweet I gotta take me a chance  
Rose out of my seat just had to dance  
Started movin' my feet well a clappin' my hands  
Well the joint started  
  
Rockin' Going 'Round and around  
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound  
A well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down  
  
Twelve o'clock

Front doors was locked  
Well the place was packed  
When the police knocked  
Both doors flew back

"Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last  
Night now they blew up his house too  
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready  
For a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do  
  
Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state  
And the D.A. can't get no relief  
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and  
The gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth

Everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back  
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and  
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City  
  
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away  
But I got debts that no honest man can pay  
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust  
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now our luck may have died and out love may  
Be cold but with you forever I'll stay  
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold  
So put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold and maybe everything
dies  
That's a fact but maybe everything that dies  
Someday comes back  
  
Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find  
Down here it's just winners and losers and  
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line  
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end  
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm  
Gonna do a little favor for him  
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday  
Comes back  
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and  
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City

"In my dream our love was lost, I lived by luck and fate  
I carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn't be too late  
Now I'm standin' on this empty road where nothin' moves but the wind  
  
Once I was your treasure and I saw your face in every star  
But the promises we make at night, oh that's all they are  
Unless we fill them with faith and love they're empty as the howlin' wind  
And honey I just want to be back in your arms  
Back in your arms again  
  
You came to me with love and kindness  
But all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness  
I met you with indifference and I don't know why  
Now I wake from my dream, I wkae from my dream to this world  
Where all is shadow and darkness and a above me a dark sky unfurls  
And all the love I've thrown away and lost I'm longin' for again  
Now darlin' I just want to be back in your arms  
Back in your arms again

"I see a bad moon rising  
I see troubles on the way  
I see earthquakes and lightning  
I see bad times today  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
I hear hurricanes a-blowin'  
I know the end it's coming soon  
I fear rivers overflowing  
I hear the voice of rage and ruin  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
Hope you got your things together  
Hope you're quite prepared to die  
Looks like we're in for nasty weather  
One eye is taken for an eye  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
Don't go 'round tonight

"Lights out tonight  
Trouble in the heartland  
Got a head-on collision  
Smashin' in my guts man  
I'm caught in a crossfire  
That I don't understand  
I don't give a damn  
For the same old played out scenes  
I don't give a damn  
For just the in-betweens  
Honey I want the heart, I want the soul  
I want control right now  
Talk about a dream  
Try to make it real  
You wake up in the night  
With a fear so real  
Spend your life waiting  
For a moment that just don't come  
Well don't waste your time waiting  
  
[Chorus]  
Badlands, you gotta live it every day  
Let the broken hearts stand  
As the price you've gotta pay  
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood  
And these badlands start treating us good  
  
Workin' in the fields  
Til you get your back burned  
Workin' 'neath the wheel  
Till you get your facts learned  
Baby got my facts  
Learned real good right now  
Poor man want to be rich  
Rich man want to be king  
And a king ain't satisfied  
Till he rules everything  
I want to go out tonight  
I want to find out what I got  
  
I believe in the love that you gave me  
I believe in the faith that can save me  
I believe in the hope  
And I pray that some day it may raise me  
Above these badlands  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For the ones who had a notion  
A notion deep inside  
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive  
I want to find one face that ain't looking through me  
I want to find one place  
I want to spit in the face of these badlands

"He lay his blanket underneath the freeway  
As the evening sky grew dark  
Took a sniff of toncho from his coke can  
And headed through Balboa Park  
Where the men in their Mercedes  
Come nightly to employ  
In the cool San Diego evening  
The services of the border boys  
  
He grew up near the Zona Norte  
With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with  
He swallowed their balloons of cocaine  
Brought 'em across the Twelfth Street strip  
Sleeping in a shelter  
If the night got too cold  
Runnin' from the migra  
Of the border patrol  
  
Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks  
And in through the storm drain  
They stretched their blankets out 'neath the freeway  
And each one took a name  
There was X-man and Cochise  
Little Spider his sneakers covered in river mud  
They come north to California  
End up with the poison in their blood  
  
He did what he had to do for the money  
Sometimes he sent home what he could spare  
The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho  
And jeans like the gavachos wear  
  
One night the border patrol swept Twelfth Street  
A big car come fast down the boulevard  
Spider stood caught in its headlights  
Got hit and went down hard  
As the car sped away Spider held his stomach  
Limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass  
Lie there tasting his own blood on his tongue  
Closed his eyes and listened to the cars  
Rushin' by so fast

"Father, I have come.  
To tell you about somethin' I done.  
Well as the night reared its light head  
Into a baby's sun,  
We rolled down into the town  
From where the black throats come.  
  
And you know there was a robb'ry.  
There was a holdup.  
Ooh, there was a shootout.  
And there was a killin'.  
And there's blood on my hands.  
Today I killed a man.  
  
Well now, sister, you know me well.  
And you ask me well, how it was I felt.  
Well, she had an appetite for lovin'  
Only a fadin' beauty could posses.  
She knew just what she wanted  
And she wouldn't take less.  
  
I figured it was a small town.  
It was at sundown.  
It was just a small crowd of people around.  
Oh! But he wouldn't put his guns down.  
No, he wouldn't put his guns down.  
Oh, he wouldn't put his guns down.  
Now his blood's on my hands.  
Today I killed a man.  
  
And, papa, you showed me the beauty of buckshot.  
Well, that song a bullet sings as she whistles.  
And showed me the story of the self-loading pistol.  
  
Well now, father. I have come.  
To tell you about somethin' I done.  
He had a widow, runnin' through town screamin'.  
He had a brother, and his tears were streamin'.  
Now I'm movin' on the border  
With a rifle on my shoulder.  
  
'cuz, daddy, you showed me the beauty of buckshot.  
The love song a bullet sings as she whistles.  
And showed me the glory of the self-loading pistol.  
  
And I just come to tell ya,  
That it don't hurt no more.  
No, it don't hurt no more,  
'cuz your son, he's an outlaw.  
Oh, your son, he's an outlaw.  
Yes, your son, he's an outlaw.  
Oh, your son, he's an outlaw.  
Now, your son, he's an outlaw.  
Oh, your son, he's an outlaw.  
And this blood feels good on my hands.  
Today I killed a man.

"Your scrapbook's filled with pictures of all your leading men  
Well baby don't put my picture in there with them  
Don't make us some little girl's dream that can't ever come true  
That only serves to hurt and make you cry like you do  
Well baby don't do it to me and I won't do it to you  
  
You see all the romantic movies, you dream and take the boys home  
But when the action fades you're left all alone  
You deserve better than this, little girl, can't you see that you do  
Do you need somebody to prove it to you?  
Well you prove it to me and I'll prove it to you  
  
Now every night you go out looking for true love's satisfaction  
But in the morning you end up settling for just lights, camera, action  
  
And another cameo role with some bit player you're befriending  
You're gonna go broken-hearted looking for that happy ending  
Well girl you're gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold  
Cryin' alone in the theater as the credits roll  
  
You say I'll be like those other guys  
Who filled your head with pretty lies  
And dreams that can never come true  
Well baby you be true to me  
And I'll be true to you

Because the night belongs to us  
Because the night belongs to lovers

What I'm not I have learned  
Desire and hunger is the fire I breathe  
Just stay in my bed till the morning comes

Your love is here and now

Though I cannot live forgive me now  
The time has come to take this moment and  
They can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night

"Well my soul checked out missing as I sat listening  
To the hours and minutes tickin' away  
Yeah just sittin' around waitin' for my life to begin  
While it was all just slippin' away  
I'm tired of waitin' for tomorrow to come  
Or that train to come roarin' round the bend  
I got a new suit of clothes a pretty red rose  
And a woman I can call my friend  
  
These are better days baby  
Yeah there's better days shining through  
These are better days baby  
Better days with a girl like you  
  
Well I took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss  
It's like eatin' caviar and dirt  
It's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending  
A rich man in a poor man's shirt  
Now my ass was draggin' when from a passin' gypsy wagon  
Your heart like a diamond shone  
Tonight I'm layin' in your arms carvin' lucky charms  
Out of these hard luck bones  
  
These are better days baby  
These are better days it true  
These are better days  
There's better days shining through  
  
Now a life of leisure and pirate's treasure  
Don't make much for tragedy  
But it's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin  
And can't stand the company  
Every fool's got a reason for feelin' sorry for himself  
And turning his heart to stone  
Tonight this fool's halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell  
And I feel like I'm comin' home  
  
These are better days baby  
There's better days shining through  
These are better days  
Better days with a girl like you  
  
These are better days baby  
These are better days it's true  
These are better days  
Better days are shining through

"Bishop danced with a thumbscrew woman  
Did a double-quick back flip and slid across the floor  
The Catholic traffic flowed freely 'cross the river  
And fiddlestick fiddled quick out the front door  
Oh baby dumpling, mama's in the back tree  
If the bow breaks mama might fall  
Little sad and only, baby don't be lonely  
Mama knows 'rithmatic, knows how to take a fall  
Mama knows 'rithmatic, knows how to take a fall  
  
And the kids are crying ""Flapjacks, make 'em fat"", early in the mornin'  
Little Jack, grab your hat, hear the breakfast call  
Muskrat, bat a cat, kick him in the fireplace  
There's someone in the kitchen blowing ""Dinah"" on their horn  
There's someone in the kitchen blowing ""Dinah"" like they're born

She glides like a monkey-mule kicking on the back slide  
Over hill, over hill, daddy don't you spill now  
Papa got a switch stick, he's pumping little Bill  
Papa got a switch stick, he's pumping little Bill  
And Billy, he's crying ""Tomahawk, tomahawk, daddy better duck now""

Monatuk, Ocanuk, runnin' through my dreams now  
With fire on their fingertips and Indian screams  
With fire on their fingertips and feathers made of moonbeams

""I seen the sailor's warning in the western sky""  
Well mountain man, if you can, cut me down a fir tree  
Branches full of candlesticks for baby and me  
And my darling cried, she said ""Honey, the weathervane  
Lately it's been pointing the way to heaven  
Scatterbrains, scatterbrains, watch out where you fall  
Champagne, champagne, a round for all the old choir boys  
They're busting off the altar chasing Dinah through the hall

"Rainey Williams' playground was the Mott Haven streets where he ran past
melted candles and flower wreaths, names and photos of young black faces,
whose death and blood consecrated these places. Rainey's mother said, ""Rainey
stay at my side, for you are my blessing you are my pride. It's your love here
that keeps my soul alive. I want you to come home from school and stay
inside.""  
  
Rainey'd do his work and put his books away. There was a channel showed a
western movie everyday. Lynette brought him home books on the black cowboys of
the Oklahoma range and the Seminole scouts who fought the tribes of the Great
Plains. Summer come and the days grew long. Rainey always had his mother's
smile to depend on. Along a street of stray bullets he made his way, to the
warmth of her arms at the end of each day.  
  
Come the fall the rain flooded these homes, here in Ezekiel's valley of dry
bones, it fell hard and dark to the ground. It fell without a sound. Lynette
took up with a man whose business was the boulevard, whose smile was fixed in
a face that was never off guard. In the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink his
secrets he kept. In the day, behind drawn curtains, in Lynette's bedroom he
slept.  
  
Then she got lost in the days. The smile Rainey depended on dusted away, the
arms that held him were no more his home. He lay at night his head pressed to
her chest listening to the ghost in her bones.  
  
In the kitchen Rainey slipped his hand between the pipes. From a brown bag
pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side, stood in the
dark at his mother's bed, brushed her hair and kissed her eyes.  
  
In the twilight Rainey walked to the station along streets of stone. Through
Pennsylvania and Ohio his train drifted on. Through the small towns of Indiana
the big train crept, as he lay his head back on the seat and slept. He awoke
and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green, corn and cotton and an
endless nothin' in between. Over the rutted hills of Oklahoma the red sun
slipped and was gone. The moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone.

"Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat  
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat  
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-
round  
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the
ground  
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers,
clappin' his hands  
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her
hand  
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws
his lover in the sand  
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, ""Daddy's within earshot, save the
buckshot, turn up the band""  
  
And she was blinded by the light  
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light  
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright  
  
Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East  
He says, ""Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they
expect it least""  
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the
young girls dance  
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him
of the feeling of romance  
  
Yeah, he was blinded by the light  
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light  
He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight  
  
Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes  
She said, ""I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song
with the funky break""  
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to
go outside  
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a
ride  
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier  
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling
card, he said, ""Do what you like, but don't do it here""  
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and
asked him which was the way back home  
He said, ""Take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and
then, boy, you're on your own""  
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar
tune  
Yes, and the avatar said, ""Blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're
gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon""  
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some
mousetrap he bought last night  
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured
he'd be all right  
  
He was just blinded by the light  
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light  
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun  
Oh, but Mama, that's where the fun is

I was blinded  
I was blinded

"We played king of the mountain out on the end  
The world come chargin' up the hill, and we were women and men  
Now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away  
We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take  
We stood side by side each one fightin' for the other  
We said until we died we'd always be blood brothers  
  
Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away  
Makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make  
And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray  
We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay  
And it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover  
With no one runnin' by your side my blood brother  
  
On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks  
Always movin' ahead and never lookin' back  
Now I don't know how I feel, I don't know how I feel tonight  
If I've fallen 'neath the wheel, if I've lost or I've gained sight  
I don't even know why, I don't why I made this call  
Or if any of this matters anymore after all  
  
But the stars are burnin' bright like some mystery uncovered  
I'll keep movin' through the dark with you in my heart  
My blood brother

"I'm standing in the backyard  
Listening to the party Inside  
Tonight I'm drinkin' in the forgiveness  
This life provides  
The scars we carry remain but the pain slips away it seems  
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams  
  
I'm watchin' you through the window  
With your girlfriends from back home  
You're showin' off your dress  
There's laughter and a toast  
From your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen  
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams  
  
In the darkness my fingers slip across your skin  
I feel your sweet reply  
The room fades away and suddenly I'm way up high  
Just holdin' you to me  
As through the window the moonlight streams  
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams  
  
Now the ritual begins  
'Neath the wedding garland we meet as strangers  
The dance floor is alive with beauty  
Mystery and danger  
We dance out 'neath the stars' ancient light into the darkening trees  
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams

"Born down in a dead mans town  
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground  
End up like a dog that's been beat too much  
Till you spend half your life just covering up  
  
Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.  
I was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.  
  
Got in a little hometown cream  
So they put a rifle in my hand  
Sent me off to a foreign land  
To go and kill the yellow man  
  
Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.  
  
Come back home to the refinery  
Hiring man said ""son if it was up to me""  
Went down to see my V.A. man  
He said ""son, don't you understand""  
  
I had a brother at Khe Sahn  
Fighting off the Viet Cong  
They're still there, he's all gone  
  
He had a woman he loved in Saigon  
I got a picture of him in her arms now  
  
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary  
Out by the gas fires of the refinery  
I'm ten years burning down the road  
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go  
  
Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A.

"I hold you in my arms  
As the band plays  
What are those words whispered baby  
Just as you turn away  
I saw you last night  
Out on the edge of town  
I want to read your mind  
To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found  
So tell me what I see  
When I look in your eyes  
Is that you baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
I heard somebody call your name  
From underneath our willow  
I saw something tucked in shame  
Underneath your pillow  
Well I've tried so hard baby  
But I just can't see  
What a woman like you  
Is doing with me  
So tell me who I see  
When I look in your eyes  
Is that you baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
Now look at me baby  
Struggling to do everything right  
And then it all falls apart  
When out go the lights  
I'm just a lonely pilgrim  
I walk this world in wealth  
I want to know if it's you I don't trust  
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself  
  
Now you play the loving woman  
I'll play the faithful man  
But just don't look too close  
Into the palm of my hand  
We stood at the altar  
The gypsy swore our future was bright  
But come the wee wee hours  
Well maybe baby the gypsy lied  
So when you look at me  
You better look hard and look twice  
Is that me baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
Tonight our bed is cold  
Lost in the darkness of our love  
God have mercy on the man  
Who doubts what he's sure of

"I lie in bed but baby I can't sleep no matter how hard I try  
There's something bad, baby, wrong with me whenever I close my eyes  
The dreams of Mary keep me awake with every little curve in place  
When I walk home in the daybreak I pray come back home, baby, won't you give
me  
Darlin' bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin', bring on the night  
  
I walk the street, I'm lookin' for romance  
I end up stumblin' in some stupid half-trance  
As I watch the lovers mix with circumstance  
We watch the disco dancers dance  
  
I look for connection in some new eyes  
But for protection they're tranquilized  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who lies  
  
Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin', bring on the night  
  
Is it as simple as it seems  
I don't know what I'm doin' here, is it as simple as it seems  
Is it as simple as I fear, well if I'm right...  
  
I look for connection in some new eyes  
But for protection they're tranquilized  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who  
Baby of who's tellin' who lies  
  
Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin', bring on the night, oh now darlin', bring on the night  
Come on darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin' bring on the night

"Saigon, it was all gone  
The same Coke machines  
As the streets I grew on  
Down in a mesquite canyon  
We come walking along the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Campsite's an hour's walk from the nearest road to town  
Up here there's too much brush and canyon  
For the CHP choppers to touch down  
Ain't lookin' for nothin', just want to live  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
Come the Santa Ana's, man, that dry brush'll light  
Billy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night  
We buried his body in the white stone high up along the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Had enough of town and the street life  
Over nothing you end up on the wrong end of someone's knife  
Now I don't want no trouble  
And I ain't got none to give  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
I come home in '72  
You were just a beautiul light  
In your mama's dark eyes of blue  
I stood down on the tarmac, I was just a kid  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Come Veterans' Day I sat in the stands in my dress blues  
I held your mother's hand  
When they passed with the red, white and blue  
One minute you're right there ... and something slips...

"I get up in the evening, and I ain't got nothing to say

I ain't nothing but tired, man I'm just tired and bored with myself

I check my look in the mirror wanna change my clothes my hair my face  
Man I ain't getting nowhere I'm just livin in a dump like this  
There's something happening somewhere baby I just know that there is

You sit around getting older there's a joke here somewhere and it's on me  
I'll shake this world off my shoulders come on baby the laughs on me  
Stay on the streets of this town and they'll be carving you up alright  
They say you got to stay hungry hey baby I'm just about starving tonight  
I'm dying for some action I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write  
This book  
I need a love reaction come on baby give me just one look  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't start a fire, sittin' 'round cryin' over a broken heart  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
You can't start a fire, worryin' about your little world falling apart  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

"Remember the morning we dug up your gun  
The worms in the barrel, the hanging sun  
Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin  
The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in  
The rush of your lips, the feel of your name  
The beat in your heart, the devil's arcade  
  
You said ""Heroes are needed, so heroes get made""  
Somebody made a bet, somebody paid  
The cool desert morning and nothing to save  
Just metal and plastic where your body caved  
The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray  
In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name  
Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade  
  
You sleep and you dream, your buddies Charlie and James  
And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin  
  
Voice says ""don't worry, I'm here  
Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear""  
House on a quiet street, a home for the brave  
A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face  
  
Rising from a long night as dark as the grave  
On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith  
On a morning to order a breakfast to make  
A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits  
For the touch of your fingers, the end of the day  
  
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart, the beat of her heart  
The beat of your heart, the slow burning away  
Of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade  
  
[Terri's Song Begins]  
  
Well they built the Titanic to be one of a kind, but many ships have ruled the
seas  
They built the Eiffel Tower to stand alone, but they could build another if
they please  
Taj Mahal, the pyramids of Egypt, are unique I suppose  
But when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
Now the world is filled with many wonders under the passing sun  
And sometimes something comes along and you know it's for sure the only one  
The Mona Lisa, the David, the Sistine Chapel, Jesus, Mary, and Joe  
And when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
When they built you, brother, they turned dust into gold  
When they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
They say you can't take it with you, but I think that they're wrong  
'Cause all I know is I woke up this morning, and something big was gone  
Gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold  
Just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
Now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth  
And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and
cursed  
But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told  
And when she built you, brother, she broke the mold  
  
That attitude's a power stronger than death, alive and burning her stone cold  
When they built you, brother

"Hey bus driver, keep the change

Christmas crier bustin' cane  
He's in love again

To someday own the rodeo  
Tainted women in VistaVision

Rex said that lady left him limp

Queen of diamonds, ace of spades  
Newly discovered lovers of the Everglades  
They take out a full-page ad in the trades  
To announce their arrival  
And Mary Lou, she found out how to cope  
She rides to heaven on a gyroscope

She said, ""Man, the dope's that there's still hope""

Wipes her eyes and blows her nose

"Cold rain running down the front of my shirt  
I'm flat on my back wheels in the dirt  
Angel makes her face up out on Baker Street  
She's straddling the shifter in my front seat  
There's nothing to lose, it's a heartbreak  
The deck's stacked  
So put your foot to the floor and darling don't look back  
  
We're making night tracks through the blazing rain  
Blowin' pistons, workin' the fast lane  
Red line burnin', pocket's full of cash  
Angel writes her name in lipstick on my dash  
There's nothing to lose  
It's a bad break but baby we're backed  
Tonight we'll blow off the doors and honey we won't look back  
We held it in our hearts in the pourin' rain  
We made it through the heart of a hurricane  
We tore it apart and put it together again  
  
Well angel, won't you believe in love for me  
C'mon and meet me tonight, darling, out in the street  
We'll move with the city in the dark  
You got to walk, it talk, it in your heart  
There's nothin' to lose it's a heartache  
The deck's stacked  
So put your foot to the floor, darling  
Tonight we'll blow off the doors, baby  
We're gonna even the score  
And honey we won't look back

"Sun comes every morning but it ain't no friend  
I get dressed and I go back again  
The rain keeps on falling on twisted bones and dirt  
I'm buried to my heart here in this hurt  
Fire keeps on burning, you're waiting in the cold  
Down in the hole  
  
Dark and bloody autumn pierces my heart  
The memory of your kiss tears me apart  
The sky above is turning, the world below's gone gray  
I thought that I could turn and walk away  
Fire keeps on burning, and I'm working in the cold  
Down in the hole  
  
Radio's crackling with the headlines, wind in the phone lines  
The sun upon your shoulder, empty city skylines  
The day rips apart, a dark and bloody arrow pierced my heart  
  
I got nothing but heart and sky and sunshine, the things you left behind  
I wake to find my city's gone to black  
The days just keep on falling, your voice it keeps on calling  
I'm gonna dig right here until I get you back  
Fires keep on burning, I'm here with you in the cold  
Down in the hole  
  
Down in the hole

"When I lost you honey sometimes I think I lost my guts too  
And I wish God would send me a word  
Send me something I'm afraid to lose  
Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives  
I get shivers down my spine and all I want to do is hold you tight  
  
[Chorus]  
I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes  
And to taste your tender charms  
And I just want to sleep tonight again in your arms  
  
Tonight there's fallen angels and they're waiting for us down in the street  
Tonight there's calling strangers,  
Hear them crying in defeat.  
Let them go, let them go, let them go,  
Do their dances of the dead (let'em go right ahead)  
You just dry your eyes girl, and c'mon c'mon  
C'mon let's go to bed, baby, baby, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's machines and there's fire waiting on the edge of town  
They're out there for hire but baby they can't hurt us now  
'Cause you've got, you've got, you've got,  
You've got my love, you've got my love  
Through the wind, through the rain, the snow, the wind, the rain  
You've got, you've got my, my love  
Heart and soul

"I threw my robe on in the morning  
Watched the ring on the stove turn to red  
Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee  
Pulled on my boots and made the bed  
Screen door hangin' off its hinges  
Kept bangin' me awake all night  
As I look out the window  
The only thing in sight  
  
Is dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind  
  
I chased the heat of her blood  
Like it was the holy grail  
Descend beautiful spirit  
Into the evening pale  
Her appaloosa's  
Kickin' in the corral smelling rain  
There's a low thunder rolling  
'Cross the mesquite plain  
But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line  
It's just dry lightning and you on my mind  
  
I'd drive down to Alvarado street  
Where she danced to make ends meet  
I'd spend the night over my gin  
As she'd talk to her men  
  
Well the piss yellow sun  
Comes bringin' up the day  
She said ""ain't nobody gonna give nobody  
What they really need anyway""  
  
Well you get so sick of the fightin'  
You lose your fear of the end  
But you can't lose your memory  
And the sweet smell of your skin  
And it's just dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind

"One, two, three, four  
  
Girl, on the edge flippin' off the lamp  
There'll be an end darling to your endless night  
On the other side of the street.  
Yea, the light on your portrait and the light in your face  
And you'll be looking for another pretty place  
Baby, this side of the street.  
  
Well, keep dreaming baby that your desire brings and girl  
I know the sadness that you find in things, it's true  
Well, baby if you can't take the heat, what can I do?  
  
Well, you and your poetry and your boku world  
Behind the face you hide the face of a modern girl  
On the other side of the street.  
Yea, you've got the look as if you owe the world  
Therefore, you go out there and say what you can earn  
On the wrong side of the street.  
  
Well, you tire of every day bringing the same and so you  
Go out looking for some strange new games  
Well, pretty soon you don't know the score anymore.  
  
All right now... (guitar break)  
  
I know the danger that your desire brings  
And I know the strangeness that you'll find  
Wait and it will seem straighter for you and for me.  
Well, turn on the end and baby turn off the lamps  
There'll be an end darling to this endless night  
On the other side of the street.  
  
Yea, and everyday well it just brings the same  
You started looking for some very strange new games  
On the wrong side of the street.  
Well, you and your desires lead to confusion  
Well, walk away as I don't follow your illusions  
And see, open your eyes and see, girl.  
  
All right...

"I've got a mule and her name is Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
She's a good old worker and a good old pal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
We haul'd some barges in our day  
Filled with lumber, coal and hay  
We know every inch of the way  
From Albany to Bufallo  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
We'd better look around for a job, old gal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
You can bet your life I'll never part Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
  
Get up mule, here comes a lock  
We'll make Rome 'bout six o'clock  
One more trip and we'll go  
Right back home to Buffalo  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
Where would I be if I lost my pal?  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
I'd like to see a mule as good as my Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
  
A friend of mine once got her sore  
Now he's got a broken jaw  
'Cause she let fly with an iron toe  
And kicked him back to Bufallo  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal

"When I get home from my job  
I turn on my t.v.  
But I can't keep my mind on the show  
When I lay down at night  
I don't get no sleep  
So I turn on the radio  
But, lord, the only thing I hear  
Is you whisperin' in my ear  
The words that you used to say  
Well, now the days grow longer  
My love grows stronger  
And the fever gets worse every day  
  
I got a fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Nothing that a boy can do  
When he's got the fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Left this little boy blue  
  
I can remember comin' home  
See you standin' at the stove  
With the dishes on the table  
Dinner ready to go  
Or maybe out to a movie show  
Something that you'd like to see  
Oh, you were my sun in the morning  
And my moon at night  
When you put your arms around me  
Made me fell alright  
Well, now the days grow longer  
And my love just grows stronger  
And the fever gets so bad at night  
  
I got a fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever nothing that a boy can do  
When he's got the fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Left this little boy blue  
  
It's gonna be alright, now  
If I can make it to the morning  
I'm gonna be alright, now  
If I can just make it to the morning  
  
It's just this long and lonely nights  
Every time I close my eyes  
All I see is her face  
Every time I shut my eyes  
All I see is her face  
But I'm gonna be alright, now  
I'll be alright, now  
When I shut down all the lights  
When I turn off all the lights  
When I turn down all the lights  
And when I lay my head on the pillow  
I can't stop myself in thinking  
""Baby, where are you tonight? ""  
""Where is she tonight? ""

"If your heart is restless and you can't go on  
When you're tired and weary, but you can't go on  
Well a distant dream is a callin' you  
Then there's just one thing that you can do  
  
Yeah, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead you  
You gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
  
Now if I walk in dreams  
And if I talk in dreams  
I need someone with a love I can trust  
And together we'll search for the things that come to us  
Baby in dreams, in dreams  
  
Now every man has the right to live  
The right to a chance to give what he has to give  
The right to fight for the things he believes  
For the things that come to him in dreams  
  
Baby in dreams, I walk in dreams  
I talk in dreams  
I live in dreams

"Princess cards she sends me with her regards  
Barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard  
Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted  
To her Cheshire smile, I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted  
But you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts  
Honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back  
You wouldn't even give me time to cover my tracks  
You said, ""Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks""  
But they're not what I came for, and I'm sure you see that too  
  
[Chorus:]  
I came for you, for you, I came for you  
But you did not need my urgency  
I came for you, for you, I came for you  
But your life was one long emergency  
And your cloud line urges me  
And my electric surges free  
  
Crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak  
Reveal yourself all now to me, girl, while you've got the strength to speak  
'Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks  
But I could give it all to you now, if only you could ask  
And don't call for your surgeon, even he says it's too late  
It's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate  
Don't give me my money, honey, I don't want it back  
You and your pony face and your Union Jack  
Well, take your local joker and teach him how to act  
I swear I was never that way, even when I really cracked  
Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive  
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?  
And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive  
You could laugh and cry in a single sound  
  
And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds  
Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god?  
  
You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach  
Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach  
And the band, they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek  
That ragged, jagged melody, she still clings to me like a leech  
But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way  
Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way  
We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar  
Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore  
So you left to find a better reason than the one we were living for  
And it's not that nursery mouth that I came back for  
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor  
'Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors  
And who am I to ask you to lick my sores?  
And you should know that's true  
  
[Chorus:]

Where the gun is cocked, and the bullet's cold  
Where the miles are marked in blood and gold  
I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Got my dead man's suit, and my smilin' skull ring  
My lucky graveyard boots, and a song to sing  
I got a song to sing, to keep me out of the cold  
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign  
If there's a light up ahead, well brother I don't know  
But I got this fever burnin' in my soul  
So let's take the good times as they go

Poison snake bites you, you're poison too""

Lovers they walk by  
Holdin' hands two by two

Bicycle spokes spin 'round

Tonight I'm gonna burn this town down

In the cool of the evening light

Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light  
Big bank clock chimes  
Off go the sleepy front porch lights

And says ""penny for your thoughts now my boy Bill""

Swore I'd get you back I was so sure  
I'd get you back like I done so many times before

You came runnin' back but to my surprise  
Well there was somethin' gone in Gloria's eyes  
  
Well in the dark when it was just me and you  
I asked the question that I knew the answer to  
Is that a smile my little dolly on the shelf  
Tell me is that a smile  
Or is it something else?  
  
Now I work hard to prove my love is true  
Now I work hard and I bring it on home to you  
At night I pray as silently you lie  
Some day my love again will rise

"Well he'd been hearing too many voices and feelin'a little off-rack  
Like there was something big pressing down on his back  
So he called up his friends and they said come on out west  
It's a place where a man can really feel his succes  
  
So he pulled his heart and soul down off the shelf  
Packed them next to the faith that he'd lost in himself  
Said his good-byes and when the dirty work was done  
He turned his wheels into the fading sun  
  
For seven days and nights like a black-top bird he sped  
Maintained radio silence 'cept for in his head  
And just like his folks did back in '69  
He crossed the border at Needles and heard the promised land on the line  
  
Now where the Transcontinental dumps into the sea  
There's a bar made up to look like 1963  
Girl in the corner eyed him like a hungry dog a bone  
As he brushed the desert dust off that Mercedes chrome  
Bartender said ""Hey, how's it hangin', tiger?""  
He had a shot of tequila, smiled and whispered ""lighter""  
  
He went down to the desert city where the rattlesnakes play  
And left his dead skin by the roadside in the noon of day  
Sun got so hot it almost felt like friend  
It could burn out every trace of where you been  
  
There was a woman he'd met in a desert song  
A little while later a son come along  
Looked at that boy's smile and called it home  
And that night as he lay in bed the only voice he heard was his own

And my blind eye to the sun  
  
I had all of the riches  
I had each and every one  
I had all of the riches  
I had each and every one  
I had my good eye to the dark  
And my blind eye to the sun

You were the only one  
Had my good eye to the dark  
And my blind eye to the sun

"Monday morning runs to Sunday night  
Screaming slow me down before the new year dies  
It won't take much to kill a lovin' smile  
And every mother with a baby cryin in her arms singin  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
  
Coming from the city, coming from the wild  
I see a breathless army breaking like a cloud  
They're gonna smother love, they're gonna shoot your hopes  
Before the meek inherit they'll learn to hate themselves  
  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
  
Tell me someone now, what's the price  
I wanna buy some time and maybe live my life  
I wanna have a wife, I wanna have some kids  
I wanna look in their eyes and know they'll stand a chance  
  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes

"I slipped on her shoe, she was a perfect size seven  
I said ""there's no smokin' in the store ma'am""  
She crossed her legs and then  
We made some small talk, that's where it should have stopped  
She slipped me a number, I put it in my pocket  
My hand slipped up her skirt, everything slipped my mind  
In that little roadhouse On highway 29  
  
It was a small town bank, it was a mess  
Well I had a gun, you know the rest  
Money on the floorboards, shirt was covered in blood  
And she was cryin', her and me we headed south  
On highway twenty nine  
  
In a little desert motel, the air it was hot and clean  
L slept the sleep of the dead, I didn't dream  
I woke in the morning washed my face in the sink  
We headed into the Sierra Madres 'cross the borderline  
The winter sun, shot through the black trees  
I told myself it was all something in her  
But as we drove I knew it was something in me  
Something had been comin' for a long long time  
And something that was here with me now  
On highway twenty nine  
  
The road was filled with broken glass and gasoline  
She wasn't sayin' nothin'', it was just a dream  
The wind come silent through the windshield  
All I could see was snow and sky and pines  
I closed my eyes and I was runnin',  
I was runnin' then I was flyin'

"Hey, go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns go drifting by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Well, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
I know your clothes are torn and ragged  
Hey, and your hair is turning gray  
Hey, lift your head and smile at trouble  
Hey, you'll find peace and rest some day  
  
Now go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Hey, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
My, don't you worry about tomorrow  
Just let tomorrow come and go  
'Cause tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar  
Hey, safe from all that wind and snow  
  
Now go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Hey, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
Hey, I know police they cause you trouble  
Hey, they cause trouble everywhere  
But when you die and go to heaven  
You'll find no policemen there  
  
So go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Hey, that's a hobo's lullaby

Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Can't you hear the steel rail humming?

"Verse 1:  
I worked hard, baby, night and day  
The things i had somebody took away  
They took away everything i earned  
But there's one lesson that'a i have learned  
  
Chorus:  
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (4x)  
  
Verse 2:  
I been pushed and i been knocked down  
But i picked myself right back up off the ground  
And baby there's one thing that i have found  
Fighting's the only way's to stand your ground  
  
Chorus:  
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (4x)  
  
Bridge:  
I've been used, i've been abused  
I've had, baby, my regrets  
I've been lost, i paid the cost  
But there's one thing i ain't gonna forget  
  
Verse 3:  
I've heard some hard lines, i've seen some cryin' times  
Bad luck and trouble they been friends of mine  
Got to stand straight and stare right at your face (fate?)  
And play it hard before it's too late  
  
Chorus:  
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (8x)

"""Well, the doctor comes 'round here with his face all bright  
And he says, ""In a little while you'll be all right""  
All he gives is a humbug pill, a dose of dope and a great big bill  
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?  
  
He says, ""Me and my old school pals had some might high times 'round here  
And what happened to you poor black folks, well it just ain't fair""  
He took a look around, gave a little pep talk, said, ""I'm with you"" then he
took a little walk  
  
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?  
  
There's bodies floatin' on Canal Street and the levees gone to hell  
Martha, get me my sixteen gauge and some dry shells  
Them who's got got out of town  
And them who ain't got left to drown  
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?  
  
I got family scattered from Texas all the way to Baltimore  
And I ain't got no home in this world no more  
Gonna be a judgment that's a fact, a righteous train rollin' down this track  
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?

"Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack

Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Lay down your money and you play your part  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
  
I met her in a Kingstown bar  
We fell in love I knew it had to end  
We took what we had and we ripped it apart  
Now here I am down in Kingstown again  
  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Lay down your money and you play your part  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
  
Everybody needs a place to rest  
Everybody wants to have a home  
Don't make no difference what nobody says  
Ain't nobody like to be alone

Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Lay down your money and you play your part  
Everybody's got a hungry heart

"Let the frozen cities crumble, crumble and fall  
That's alright, I don't mind at all  
Let 'em all tumble right into the sea  
Well that's just fine, that's alright with me  
Since you came down the line  
I can't sleep at night, I got one thing on my mind  
That's every day, every night  
I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, that's what I want to do  
'Cause you're just so out of sight  
I want to be with you, that's what I want to do  
Now I lost my job at the Texaco station  
'Cause instead of pumping gas I'd dream of you  
I got thrown out of my house, I got such a bad reputation  
'Cause all I want to do is be seen with you  
They gave me my pay and said walk  
I don't care what they say, go ahead and let 'em all talk  
  
'Til the world falls apart  
I want to be with you  
I want to be with you

Alright, a little bit more  
Tonight, tonight give me just a little kiss  
No I don't know, I don't know, I don't  
I just can't understand it, you're not pretty at all  
But I come when you whisper, I run when you call  
When I see you on the street I fall on my face  
I drop to my knees, I plead my case  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, that's what I want to do  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, that's all I want to do  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, darlin', don't you know  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you because I love you so

"I see you walking, baby, down the street  
Pushing that baby carriage at your feet  
I see the lonely ribbon in your hair  
Tell me I am the man for whom you put it there  
  
You never smile girl, you never speak  
You just walk on by, darlin' week after week  
Raising two kids alone in this mixed up world  
Must be a lonely life for a working girl  
  
[Chorus:]  
Little girl, I want to marry you  
Oh yeah, little girl, I want to marry you  
Yes I do  
Little girl, I want to marry you  
  
Now honey, I don't want to clip your wings  
But a time comes when two people should think of these things  
Having a home and a family  
Facing up to their responsibilities  
They say in the end true love prevails  
But in the end true love can't be no fairytale  
To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong  
But maybe, darlin', I could help them along  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My daddy said right before he died  
That true, true love was just a lie  
He went to his grave a broken heart  
An unfulfilled life, makes a man hard  
  
Oh, darlin'  
There's something happy and there's something sad  
'Bout wanting somebody, oh so bad,  
I wear my love darlin', without shame  
I'd be proud if you would wear my name

"I love to see the cottonwood blossom  
In the early spring  
I love to see the message of love  
That the bluebird brings  
  
But when I see you walkin' with him  
Down along the strand  
I wish I were blind  
When I see you with your man  
  
I love to see your hair shining  
In the long summer's light  
I love to watch the stars fill the sky  
On a summer night  
  
The music plays you take his hand  
I watch how you touch him as you start to dance  
And I wish I were blind  
When I see you with your man  
  
We struggle here but all our love's in vain  
And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty  
Now fill me with pain  
And the light that once entered here  
Is banished from me  
And this darkness is all baby that my heart sees  
  
And though the world is filled  
With the grace and beauty of God's hand  
Oh I wish I were blind  
When I see you with your man

"Sleepy town ain't got the guts to budge  
Baby, this emptiness has already been judged  
I want to go out tonight, I want to find out what I got  
  
You're a strange part of me, you're a preacher's girl  
And I don't want no piece of this mechanical world  
Got my arms open wide and my blood is running hot  
  
We'll take the midnight road right to the devil's door  
And even the white angels of Eden with their flamin' swords  
Won't be able to stop us from hitting town in this dirty old Ford  
  
Well it don't take no nerve when you got nothing to guard  
I got tombstones in my eyes and I'm running real hard  
My baby was a lover and the world just blew her away  
  
Once they tried to steal my heart, beat it right outta my head  
But baby they didn't know that I was born dead  
I am the iceman, fighting for the right to live  
I say better than the glory roads of heaven better off riding  
Hellbound in the dirt, better than the bright lines of the freeway  
Better than the shadows of your daddy's church  
Better than the waiting, baby better off is the search

"We said we'd walk together baby come what may  
That come the twilight should we lose our way  
If as we're walkin a hand should slip free  
I'll wait for you  
And should I fall behind  
Wait for me  
  
We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side  
We'd help each other stay in stride  
But each lover's steps fall so differently  
But I'll wait for you  
And if I should fall behind  
Wait for me  
  
Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true  
But you and I know what this world can do  
So let's make our steps clear that the other may see  
And I'll wait for you  
If I should fall behind  
Wait for me  
  
Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead  
There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed  
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees  
I'll wait for you  
And should I fall behind  
Wait for me  
Darlin' I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind  
Wait for me

"Pour me a drink Theresa in one of those glasses you dust off  
And I'll watch the bones in your back like the stations of the cross  
'Round your hair the sun lifts a halo, at your lips a crown of thorns  
Whatever the deal's going down, to this one I'm sworn  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll work for your love dear  
I'll work for your love  
What others may want for free  
I'll work for your love  
  
The dust of civilizations and love's sweet remains  
Slip off of your fingers and come drifting down like rain  
The pages of Revelation lie open in your empty eyes of blue  
I watch you slip that comb through your hair and this I promise you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well tears they fill the rosary, at your feet my temple of bones  
Here in this perdition we go on and on  
Now I see your pieces crumbled and our book of faith's been tossed  
And I'm just down here searching for my own piece of the cross  
In the late afternoon sun fills the room with a mist in the garden before the
fall  
I watch your hands smooth the front of your blouse and seven drops of blood
fall  
  
[Chorus: x 2]

"I ain't afraid of no lions  
I ain't afraid of no grizzly bear

That make me doubt my stuff  
  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
  
Now bring down old hulk hogan  
King kong bundy too  
Bring down old big mike tyson  
I'll show them what a real man can do  
They say the tougher' get goin'  
Now baby that's when the goin' get tough  
  
But I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
  
You can bring on a different sexy girl  
At every night of the week  
Buddy that's okay  
But I start tremblin', my knees get weak  
Whenever I hear her say  
""do you love me baby? ""  
""do you love me baby? ""  
""do you love me baby? ""  
  
I got a muscle of iron  
I got another muscle made of steel  
But when we start kissin' 'n' huggin'  
You may be the bravest man in the whole wide world  
But buddy, that ain't enough  
  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love

"I got a 007 watch and it's a one and only  
It's got a I-Spy beeper that tells me when you're lonely  
I got a Batmobile so I can reach ya' in a fast shake

Now don't you call James Bond or Secret Agent Man  
'Cause they can't do it, like I can

Columbo split and you can't find Kojak

I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - every day  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - with you  
  
So you fell for some jerk who was tall, dark and handsome  
Then he kidnapped your heart and now he's holdin' it for ransom  
Well, like a mission impossible I'm gonna go and get it back  
You know I would'a taken better care of it, baby, than that  
  
Sometimes I get so hot girl, well, I can't talk  
But when I'm with you I cool off , and I walk  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, and I talk  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day

Well you let out one of your bored sighs  
Well lately when I look into your eyes  
I'm goin down  
  
We get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night  
We come home early burning, burning in some fire fight  
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up  
Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down  
  
I pull you close but when we kiss I can feel a doubt  
I remember back when we started  
My kisses used to turn you inside out  
I used to drive you to work in the morning  
Friday night I'd drive you all around  
You used to love to drive me wild  
But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down

And can he do to you the things that I do? -  
Oh no, I can take you higher

Sometimes, it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull  
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull  
  
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet  
And a freight train running through the middle of my head  
Only you, can cool my desire

"Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late  
Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now  
I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate  
We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow  
'Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us  
There's a darkness in this town that's got us too  
But they can't touch me now  
And you can't touch me now  
They ain't gonna do to me  
What I watched them do to you  
  
So say goodbye it's Independence Day  
It's Independence Day  
All down the line  
Just say goodbye it's Independence Day  
It's Independence Day this time  
  
Now I don't know what it always was with us  
We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the lines  
There was just no way this house could hold the two of us  
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind  
  
Well say goodbye it's Independence Day  
It's Independence Day all boys must run away  
So say goodbye it's Independence Day  
All men must make their way come Independence Day  
  
Now the rooms are all empty down at Frankie's joint  
And the highway she's deserted down to Breaker's Point  
There's a lot of people leaving town now  
Leaving their friends, their homes  
At night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone  
  
Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late  
Nothing we can say can change anything now  
Because there's just different people coming down here now  
And they see things in different ways  
And soon everything we've known will just be swept away  
  
So say goodbye it's Independence Day  
Papa now I know the things you wanted that you could not say  
But won't you just say goodbye it's Independence Day  
I swear I never meant to take those things away

"I had skin like leather  
And the diamond-hard look of a cobra  
I was born blue and weathered  
But, I burst just like a supernova  
I could walk like Brando right into the sun  
Then dance just like a Casanova  
  
With my blackjack and jacket  
And hair slicked sweet  
Silver star studs on my duds  
Like a Harley in heat  
  
When I strut down the street  
I could feel its heartbeat  
The sisters fell back and said  
""Don't that man look pretty""  
The cripple on the corner cried out  
""Nickels for your pity""  
Them gasoline boys, downtown, sure talk gritty  
It's so hard to be a saint in the city  
  
I was the King of the Alley  
And, oh, I could talk some trash  
I was the Prince of the Paupers  
Crowned downtown at the Beggar's Bash  
  
I was the pimp's main prophet  
I kept everything cool  
Just a backstreet gambler  
With the luck to lose  
  
And when the heat came down  
And it was left on the ground  
  
The devil appeared like Jesus  
Through the steam in the street  
Showin' me a hand  
I knew even the cops couldn't beat  
I felt his hot breath on my neck  
As I dove into the heat  
  
It's so hard to be a saint  
When you're just a boy out on the street  
  
And the sages of the subway sit  
Just like the living dead  
As the tracks clack out the rhythm  
Their eyes fixed straight ahead  
  
They ride the line of balance  
And hold on by just a thread  
But, it's too hot in these tunnels  
You can get hit up by the heat  
You get up to get out at your next stop  
But, they push you back down in your seat  
  
Your heart starts beatin' faster  
As you struggle to your feet  
Then you're outa that hole  
And back up on the street  
  
And them South Side Sisters sure look pretty  
The cripple on the corner cries out ""Nickels for your pity""  
And them downtown boys they sure talk gritty  
It's so hard to be a saint in the city  
So hard  
Oh, now...

"Driving home she grabs something to eat  
Turns a corner and drives down her street  
Into a row of houses she just melts away  
Like the scenery in another man's play  
Into a house where the blinds are closed  
To keep from seeing things she don't want to know  
She pulls the blinds and looks out on the street  
The cool of the night takes the edge off the heat  
  
In the Jackson Cage  
Down in Jackson Cage  
You can try with all your might  
But you're reminded every night  
That you been judged and handed life  
Down in Jackson Cage  
  
Every day ends in wasted motion  
Just crossed swords on the killing floor  
To settle back is to settle without knowing  
The hard edge that you're settling for  
Because there's always just one more day  
And it's always gonna be that way  
Little girl you've been down here so long  
I can tell by the way that you move you belong to  
  
The Jackson Cage  
Down in Jackson Cage  
And it don't matter just what you say  
Are you tough enough to play the game they play  
Or will you just do your time and fade away  
Down into the Jackson Cage  
  
Baby there's nights when I dream of a better world  
But I wake up so downhearted girl  
I see you feeling so tired and confused  
I wonder what it's worth to me or you  
Just waiting to see some sun  
Never knowing if that day will ever come  
Left alone standing out on the street  
Till you become the hand that turns the key down in  
  
Jackson Cage  
Down in Jackson Cage  
Well darlin' can you understand  
The way that they will turn a man  
Into a stranger to waste away  
Down in the Jackson Cage

"I got no time for the corner boys  
Down in the street making all that noise  
Or the girls out on the avenue  
'Cause tonight I want to be with you  
  
Tonight I'm gonna take that ride  
Across the river to the Jersey side  
Take my baby to the carnival  
And I'll take her on all the rides  
  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
You know all my dreams come true  
When I'm walking down the street with you  
  
Sha la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl  
  
You know she thrills me with all her charms  
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms  
My little girl gives me everything  
I know that some day she'll wear my ring  
  
So don't bother me man I ain't got no time  
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine  
'Cause nothing matters in this whole wide world  
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired  
When I come by to take you out to eat  
you're lyin' all dressed up on the bed baby fast asleep  
  
Go in the bathroom and put your makeup on  
We're gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom?s  
I know a place where the dancing?s free  
Now baby won't you come with me  
  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
Nothing matters in this whole wide world

"Well Jesus was an only son  
As he walked up Calvary Hill  
His mother Mary walking beside him  
In the path where his blood spilled  
Jesus was an only son  
In the hills of Nazareth  
As he lay reading the Psalms of David  
At his mother's feet  
  
A mother prays, ""Sleep tight, my child, sleep well  
For I'll be at your side  
That no shadow, no darkness, no tolling bell,  
Shall pierce your dreams this night.""  
  
In the garden at Gethsemane  
He prayed for the life he'd never live,  
He beseeched his Heavenly Father to remove  
The cup of death from his lips  
  
Now there's a loss that can never be replaced,  
A destination that can never be reached,  
A light you'll never find in another's face,  
A sea whose distance cannot be breached  
  
Well Jesus kissed his mother's hands  
Whispered, ""Mother, still your tears,  
For remember the soul of the universe  
Willed a world and it appeared.""

"Well she drew out all her money from the southern trust  
And put her little boy on the greyhound bus  
Leaving memphis with a guitar in his hand  
With a one way ticket to the promised land  
Hey little girl with the red dress on  
There's party tonight down in memphis down  
I'll be going down there if you need a ride  
The man on the radio says elvis presley's died  
We drove to memphis the sky was hard and black  
Up over the ridge came a white cadillac  
They drawed out all his money and they laid him in the back  
A woman cried from the roadside ""oh he's gone, he's gone""  
They found him slumped up against the drain  
With a whole lotta trouble running through his veins  
Bye bye johnny  
Johnny bye bye  
You didn't have to die  
You didn't have to die

"One night in a motel room  
Eyes cast like steel  
I drank the wine that they left on my table  
I knew the morning was too far  
I smoked my last cigarette  
I stay only to get by  
The night was dark and the land was cold  
I was frozen right to the bone  
  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up, oh  
  
Five hundred miles I have gone today  
Tomorrow it's five hundred more  
Outside my window the world passes by  
Its stranger than a dream  
  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
  
I go to work and I earn my pay, lord  
My sweat falls to the ground  
I see you now but we may never meet again child  
The ice is hanging on the door  
  
One night in a motel room  
Eyes cast like steel  
I drank the wine that they left on my table  
Knew the morning was too far  
  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would

"With you I don't hear the minutes ticking by  
I don't feel the hours as they fly  
I don't see the summer as it wanes  
Just a subtle change of light upon your face  
  
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away  
This is our kingdom of days  
  
I watched the sun as it rises and sets  
I watched the moon trace its arc with no regret  
My jacket 'round your shoulders, the falling leaves  
The wet grass on our backs as the autumn breeze drifts through the trees  
  
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
  
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I do  
You whisper ""Then prove it, then prove it, then prove it, to me baby.""  
  
When I count my blessings and you're mine for always  
We laughed beneath the covers  
And count the wrinkles and the grays  
  
Sing away, sing away, sing away, sing away  
Sing away, sing away, my darling, we'll sing away  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days

"Catlong sighs, holdin' Kitty's black tooth  
She left to marry some top cat, ain't it the cold truth?  
And there hasn't been a tally since Sally left the alley  
Since Sally left with Big Pretty, things have got pretty thin  
It's tight on this fence since them young dudes are musclin' in  
  
Jack Knife cries 'cause Baby's in a bundle  
She goes runnin' nightly, lightly through the jungle  
And them tin cans are explodin' out of the 90-degree heat

Cat shrugs his shoulders, sits back and sighs

Flashin' lights that cut the night, dude in the white says he's the man  
Well, you better move fast when you're young, or you're not around  
Cat somehow lost his Kitty in the city pound  
So get right, get tight, get down

"I want to build me a house, on higher ground  
I want to find me a world, where love's the only sound  
High above this road, filled with shadow and doubt  
I want to shoulder my load, and figure it all out  
With Leah  
  
I walk this road, with a hammer and a fiery lantern  
With this hand I've built, and with this I've burned  
I want to live in the same house, beneath the same roof  
Sleep in the same bed, search for the same proof  
As Leah  
  
I got somethin' in my heart, I been waitin' to give  
I got a life I want to start, one I been waitin' to live  
No more waitin', tonight I feel the light I say the prayer  
I open the door, I climb the stairs

I was scratchin' where it itched  
Oh heartbreak and despair got nothing but boring  
So I grabbed you baby like a wild pitch  
  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
In your heart you must trust  
  
Now your legs were heaven your breasts were the altar  
Your body was the holy land  
You shouted ""jump"" but my heart faltered  
You laughed and said ""Baby don't you understand?""  
  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
In your heart you must trust

I kissed you and slipped into a bed of roses  
The waters parted and love rushed inside  
I was Jesus' son sanctified  
  
Tonight the moon's looking young but I'm feelin' younger  
'Neath a veil of dreams sweet blessings rain  
Honey I can feel the first breeze of summer  
And in your love I'm born again

It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
In your heart you must trust

Been driving five hundred miles, got five hundred to go, yeah  
I got rock and roll music on the radio

"Early North Jersey industrial skyline  
I'm an all-set cobra jet creepin' through the night time  
Gotta find a gas station, gotta find a pay phone  
This turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone  
I'm living on the edge of the world  
Tryin' to get my girl on the line  
Livin' on the edge of the world  
But I think it's just a waste of my time  
Some jerk keeps breaking my connection, girl  
'Cause I'm living on the edge of the world

New Jersey in the morning like a lunar landscape  
Got a counter girl at the Exit 24 HoJo  
Down past the refinery towers where the great black river flows  
OI'm living on the edge of the world  
Tryin' to get a message through  
I gotta make a connection, girl  
Because I'm living on the edge of the world  
Living on the edge of the world

Lost souls callin' long distance salvation  
Hey mister deejay gotta hear my last prayer  
It's a hey ho rock and roll, deliver me from nowhere

It takes me two hours to get back to where my baby lives

Relay towers, won't you lead me to my baby  
'Neath the overpass the trooper hits his party lights switch  
  
Good night, good luck, one, two powershift

"Well now on a summer night in a dusky room  
Come a little piece of the Lord's undying light  
Crying like he swallowed the fiery moon  
In his mother's arms it was all the beauty I could take  
Like the missing words to some prayer that I could never make  
In a world so hard and dirty so fouled and confused  
Searching for a little bit of God's mercy  
I found living proof  
  
I put my heart and soul I put 'em high upon a shelf  
Right next to the faith the faith that I'd lost in myself  
I went down into the desert city  
Just tryin' so hard to shed my skin  
I crawled deep into some kind of darkness  
Lookin' to burn out every trace of who I'd been  
You do some sad sad things baby  
When it's your you 're tryin' to lose  
You do some sad and hurtful things  
I've seen living proof  
  
You shot through my anger and rage  
To show me my prison was just an open cage  
There were no keys no guards  
Just one frightened man and some old shadows for bars  
  
Well now all that's sure on the boulevard  
Is that life is just a house of cards  
As fragile as each and every breath  
Of this boy sleepin' in our bed  
Tonight let's lie beneath the eaves  
Just a close band of happy thieves  
And when that train comes we'll get on board  
And steal what we can from the treasures of the Lord  
It's been along long drought baby  
Tonight the rain's pourin' down on our roof  
Looking for a little bit of God's mercy  
I found living proof

"I was driving through my hometown  
I was just kinda killin' time  
When I seen a face staring out of a black velvet painting  
From the window of the five and dime  
I couldn't quite recall the name  
But the pose looked familiar to me  
So I asked the salesgirl ""Who was that man  
Between the doberman and Bruce Lee?""  
She said ""Just a local hero""  
""Local hero"" she said with a smile  
""Yeah a local hero he used to live here for a while""  
  
I met a stranger dressed in black  
At the train station  
He said ""Son your soul can be saved""  
There's beautiful women nights of low livin'  
And some dangerous money to be made  
There's a big town 'cross the whiskey line  
And if we turn the right cards up  
They make us boss the devil pays off  
And them folks that are real hard up  
They get their local hero  
Somebody with the right style  
They get their local hero  
Somebody with just the right smile  
  
Well I learned my job I learned it well  
Fit myself with religion and a story to tell  
First they made me the king then they made me pope  
Then they brought the rope  
  
I woke to a gypsy girl sayin' ""Drink this""  
Well my hands had lost all sensation  
These days I'm feeling all right  
'Cept I can't tell my courage from my desperation  
From the tainted chalice  
Well I drunk some heady wine  
Tonight I'm layin' here  
But there's something in my ear  
Sayin' there's a little town just beneath the floodline  
Needs a local hero  
Somebody with the right style  
Lookin' for a local hero  
Someone with the right smile  
Local hero local hero she said with a smile  
Local hero he used to live here for a while

"Out where the creek turns shallow and sandy  
And the moon comes skimmin' away the stars  
The wind in the mesquite comes rushin' over the hilltops  
Straight into my arms  
Straight into my arms  
  
I'm riding hard carryin' a catch of roses  
And a fresh map that I made  
Tonight I'm gonna get birth naked and bury my old soul  
And dance on its grave  
And dance on its grave  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here

Lived in a hotel downtown  
When I was a kid he was just somebody  
Somebody I'd see around  
Somebody I'd see around  
  
Now down below and pullin' on my shirt  
I got some kids of my own  
Well if I had one wish in this god forsaken world, kids

Yea your sins would be your own

"We met out on open streets when we had no place to go  
I remember how my heart beat when you said I love you so  
Then little by little we choked out all the life that our love could hold  
Oh no

It's like we had a noose and baby without check  
We pulled until it grew tighter around our necks  
Each one waiting for the other, darlin', to say when  
Well baby you can meet me tonight on the loose end  
  
We didn't count tomorrows, we took what we could and baby we ran  
There was no time for sorrow, every place we went I held your hand  
And when the night closed in I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know  
But oh no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our love has fallen around us like we said it never could  
We saw it happen to all the others but to us it never would  
Well how could something so bad, darling, come from something that was so good  
I don't know

"The ragamuffin gunner is returnin' home like a hungry runaway  
He walks through town all alone--""He must be from the fort,"" he hears the high
school girls say  
His countryside's burnin' with wolfman fairies dressed in drag for homicide  
The hit-and-run plead sanctuary, 'neath a holy stone they hide  
They're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection  
Nuns run bald through Vatican halls, pregnant, pleadin' immaculate conception  
And everybody's wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood  
Sticker smiles sweet as Gunner breathes deep, his ankles caked in mud  
And I said, ""Hey, gunner man, that's qucksand, that's quicksand, that ain't
mud  
Have you thrown your senses to the war, or did you lose them in the flood?""  
  
That pure American brother, dull-eyed and empty-faced  
Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight  
He rides 'er low on the hip, on the side he's got ""Bound for Glory"" in red,
white and blue flash paint  
He leans on the hood telling racing stories, the kids call him Jimmy the Saint  
Well, that blaze-and-noise boy, he's gunnin' that bitch loaded to blastin'
point  
He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point  
And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell, that is, nothin'
left that you could sell  
Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell  
And I said, ""Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil, that's blood""  
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm, or was he just lost in
the flood?  
  
Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air  
Some storefront incarnation of Maria, she's puttin' on me the stare  
And Bronx's best apostle stands with his hand on his own hardware  
Everything stops, you hear five quick shots, the cops come up for air  
And now the whiz-bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street  
And that cat from the Bronx starts lettin' loose, but he gets blown right off
his feet  
And some kid comes blastin' 'round the corner, but a cop puts him right away  
He lays on the street holding his leg, screaming something in Spanish, still
breathing when I walked away  
And somebody said, ""Hey man, did you see that? His body hit the street with
such a beautiful thud""  
I wonder what the dude was sayin', or was he just lost in the flood?  
Hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure messed up  
I wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they just lost in the flood?

"Running down the highway half past eleven  
Waitin' for my odometer to roll straight sevens  
I'm a lucky man  
I went to see the gypsy the other night  
  
She looked in my palm looked me in the eye  
Said you're a lucky man  
Some folks got fortune some got eyes of blue  
What you got will always see you through  
  
You're a lucky man  
Pa went from the army to the factory to the killing yard  
I make my living with my hands behind the wheel of this car  
I'm a lucky man  
  
Messin' with me man wouldn't be wise  
Roll them dice son - ah snake eyes  
I'm a lucky man  
Had a girl in Calgary I gave her up  
  
Man that love thing was messin' with my luck  
I'm a lucky man  
I'll wake up tomorrow morning in another state  
Kiss me now baby before it's too late  
  
If you want to kiss a lucky man  
I don't miss no girl I don't miss no home  
He travels fastest who travels alone  
He's a lucky man  
  
A man with the world in the palm of his hands

"House got too crowded clothes got too tight  
And I don't know just where I'm going tonight  
Out where the sky's been cleared by a good hard rain  
There's somebody callin' my secret name  
  
I'm going down to Lucky Town  
Going down to Lucky Town  
I want to lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots  
But that coat always had a tread hangin' loose  
Well I pulled it one night and to my surprise  
It led me right past your house and on over the rise  
  
I'm going down to Lucky Town  
Down to Lucky Town  
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
I had some victory that was just failure in deceit  
Now the joke's comin' up through the soles of my feet  
I been a long time walking on fortune's cane  
Tonight I'm steppin' lightly and feelin' no pain  
  
Well here's to your good looks baby now here's to my health  
Here's to the loaded places that we take ourselves  
When it comes to luck you make your own  
Tonight I got dirt on my hands but I'm building me a new home  
  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town

"I got a coin in your palm  
I can make it disappear  
I got a card up my sleeve  
Name it and I'll pull it out your ear  
  
I got a rabbit in the hat  
If you wanna come and see  
This is what will be  
This is what will be  
  
I got shackles on my wrists  
Soon I'll slip and I'll be gone  
Chain me in a box in the river  
And rising in the sun  
  
Trust none of what you hear  
And less of what you see  
This is what will be (This is what will be)  
This is what will be  
  
(I'll cut you in half)  
  
I got a shiny saw blade (a shiny saw blade)  
All I need's a volunteer  
I'll cut you in half  
While you're smilin' ear to ear  
  
And the freedom that you sought  
Driftin' like a ghost amongst the trees  
This is what will be  
This is what will be (This is what will be)  
  
Now there's a fire down below  
But it's coming up here  
So leave everything you know  
Carry only what you fear  
  
On the road the sun is sinkin' low  
Bodies hanging in the trees  
This is what will be (This is what will be)  
This is what will be

"Here comes a fireman, here comes a cop  
Here comes a wrench, here comes a car hop  
Been going on forever, it ain't ever gonna stop  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
[Chorus]  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
Aim your gun, son, and shoot your shot  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief  
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief  
One thing in common they all got  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man at the top says it's lonely up there  
If it is man, I don't care  
From the big white house to the parking lot  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
Here comes a banker, here comes a businessman  
Here comes a kid with a guitar in his hand  
Dreaming of his record in number-one spot  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
[Chorus]

"Well you can go out with him  
Play with all of his toys  
But takin' care of you darlin'  
Ain't for one of the boys  
Oh there's somethin' in your soul  
That he's gonna rob  
And lovin' you baby lovin' you darlin'  
Lovin' you woman is a man's man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
  
Well now his kisses may thrill  
Those other girls that he likes  
But when it comes to treatin'  
A real woman right  
Well of all of his tricks  
No they won't be enough  
'Cause lovin' you baby lovin' you woman  
Lovin' you darlin' is a man's man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
  
You're dancin' with him he's holding you tight  
I'm standing here waitin' to catch your eye  
Your hand's on his neck as the music sways  
All my illusions slip away  
  
Now if you're lookin' for a hero  
Someone to save the day  
Well darlin' my feet  
They're made of clay  
But I've got something in my soul  
And I want to give it up  
But gettin' up the nerve  
Gettin' up the nerve  
Gettin' up the nerve is a man's man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job woman  
Lovin' you's a man's job

"There's a place out on the edge of town, sir,  
Risin' above the factories and the fields  
Now, ever since I was a child, I can remember  
That mansion on the hill  
  
In the day you can see the children playing  
On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel  
Steel gates that completely surround, sir,  
The mansion on the hill  
  
At night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride  
Through the streets of a town so silent and still  
Park on a back road along the highway side  
Look up at that mansion on the hill  
  
In the summer all the lights would shine  
There'd be music playin', people laughin' all the time  
Me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall cornfields  
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill  
  
Tonight down here in Linden Town  
I watch the cars rushin' by, home from the mill  
There's a beautiful full moon rising  
Above the mansion on the hill

"
"Been on a barbed wire highway forty days and nights  
I ain't complain'n that's my job and it suits me right  
I got a sweet soul fever rushin' around my head  
I'm gonna sleep tonight in Maria's bed  
  
Got on a dead man's suit and smilin' skull ring  
Lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing  
I keep my heart in my work, my troubles in my head  
And I keep my soul in Maria's bed  
  
I been up on sugar mountain, 'cross the sweet blue sea  
I walked the valley of love and tears and mystery  
I got run out'a luck and gave myself up for dead  
Then I drank the cool clear waters from Maria's bed  
  
She give me candy stick kisses 'neath a wolf dog moon  
One sweet breath and she'll take you, mister, to the upper room  
  
I was burned by the angels, sold wings of lead  
Then I fell in the roses and sweet salvation of Maria's bed  
  
I been out in the desert, doin' my time  
Siftin' through the dust for fools gold, lookin' for a sign  
Holy man said, ""Hold on, brother, there's a light up ahead.""  
Ain't nothin' like the light that shines on me in Maria's bed  
  
Well I take my blessings at the river head  
I'm living in the light of Maria's bed

"I heard they seen you yesterday in Charles Town  
I heard about that story going round round  
All I got's a book of love with pages worn clean through  
A circle of gold and one bleeding tattoo  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
  
This town's a secret shared and shattered in a sad song  
Just a Torn and tattered pieces of a love gone wrong  
Hearts of stone and eyes gone deep blue  
Only ours is filled two by two  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
  
Summer storm blue and soft and cool  
On this slinky town streets where the love ruled  
Now it's just a misty sidewalk with the rain drifting through  
Lipstick case and one lonely red shoe  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
I heard they seen you yesterday in Charles Town

"Mary queen of Arkansas, it's not too early for dreamin'  
The sky is grown with cloud seed sown and a bastard's love can be redeeming  
Mary, my queen, your soft hulk is reviving  
No, you're not too late to desecrate, the servants are just rising  
Well I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade  
I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state  
Mary, my queen, your blows for freedom are missing  
You're not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing  
  
The big top is for dreamers, we can take the circus all the way to the  
Border  
And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order  
But I was not born to live to die and you were not born for queenin'  
It's not too late to infiltrate, the servants are just leavin'  
  
Mary queen of Arkansas, your white skin is deceivin'  
You wake and wait to lie in bait and you almost got me believin'  
But on your bed Mary I can see the shadow of a noose  
I don't understand how you can hold ma so tight and love me so damn loose  
  
But I know a place where we can go, Mary  
Where I can get a good job and start all over again clean  
I got contacts deep in Mexico where the servants have been seen

"I got seven pictures of Buddha  
The prophet's on my tongue  
Eleven angels of mercy  
Sighin' over that black hole in the sun  
My heart's dark but it's risin'  
I'm pullin' all the faith I can see  
From that black hole on the horizon  
I hear your voice calling me  
  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Tell me how do we get this thing started  
Meet me at Mary's place  
  
Familiar faces around me  
Laughter fills the air  
Your loving grace surrounds me  
Everybody's here  
Furniture's out on the front porch  
Music's up loud  
I dream of you in my arms  
I lose myself in the crowd  
  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Tell me how do you live broken-hearted  
Meet me at Mary's place  
  
I got a picture of you in my locket  
I keep it close to my heart  
It's a light shining in my breast  
Leading me through the dark  
Seven days, seven candles  
In my window lighting your way  
Your favorite record's on the turntable  
I drop the needle and pray (Turn it up)  
Band's countin' out midnight (Turn it up)  
Floor's rumblin' loud (Turn it up)  
  
Singer's callin' up daylight (Turn it up)  
And waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd  
  
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up  
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up  
  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Tell me how do we get this thing started  
Meet me at Mary's place...  
  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain

"Hey Eddie, can you lend me a few bucks  
And tonight can you get us a ride  
Gotta make it through the tunnel  
Got a meeting with a man on the other side  
  
Hey Eddie, this guy, he's the real thing  
So if you want to come along  
You gotta promise you won't say anything  
'Cause this guy don't dance  
And the word's been passed, this is our last chance  
  
We gotta stay cool tonight, Eddie  
'Cause man, we got ourselves out on that line  
And if we blow this one  
They ain't gonna be looking for just me this time  
  
And all we gotta do is hold up our end  
Here, stuff this in your pocket  
It'll look like you're carrying a friend  
And remember, just don't smile  
Change your shirt, 'cause tonight we got style  
  
Well, Cherry says she's gonna walk  
'Cause she found out I took her radio and hocked it  
But Eddie, man, she don't understand  
That two grand's practically sitting here in my pocket  
  
And tonight's gonna be everything that I said  
And when I walk through that door  
I'm just gonna throw that money on the bed  
She'll see this time I wasn't just talking  
Then I'm gonna go out walking  
  
Hey Eddie, can you catch us a ride?

"Bring it Down, band!  
Now , I just came here tonight to say  
I just want to say

Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
I feel just like I'm living in paradise  
  
Now listen  
Now you see, I feel real good tonight  
And I got music on the radio  
And I feel good tonight  
And I got music on the radio  
And I feel just like I want to kiss you  
Underneath my mistle-toe  
  
But now listen  
Santa came down chimney, half past three  
With lots of nice little presents for my baby and me  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
And I feel like I'm living, just living in paradise  
Come on boys

"Woke up this morning, was a chill in the air  
Went into the kitchen, your cigarettes were lying there  
Your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night  
Everything was in place, everything was all right  
But you were missing  
Missing...  
  
Last night I dreamed the sky went black  
You were drifting down and you couldn't get back  
You were lost and in trouble so far from home  
I reached for you, my arms went to stone  
I woke and you were missing  
Missing...  
  
I searched for something to explain  
In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves  
Tell me baby where did you go  
You were here just a moment ago  
  
There's nights I still hear your footsteps fall  
Your key in the door, your voice in the hall  
Your smell drifts through our bedroom  
I wake, but I don't move
