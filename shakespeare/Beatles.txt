"Words are flowing out like  
Endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.  
Pools of sorrow waves of joy  
Are drifting through my opened mind  
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which  
Dance before me like a million eyes,  
They call me on and on across the universe.  
Thoughts meander like a  
Restless wind inside a letter box  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world

Are ringing through my opened ears  
Inciting and inviting me.  
Limitless undying love, which  
Shines around me like a million suns,  
It calls me on and on across the universe

"Help!  
Help! I need somebody,  
Help! Not just anybody,  
Help! You know I need someone, help.  
  
When I was younger, so much younger than today,  
I never needed anybody's help in any way.  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured,  
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the doors.  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around.  
Help me get my feet back on the ground,  
Won't you please, please help me?  
  
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.  
But ev'ry now and then I feel so insecure,  
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around.  
Help me get my feet back on the ground,  
Won't you please, please help me?

"As I was slowly passing  
An orphan's home one day,  
I stopped for just a little while  
To watch the children play.  
Alone a boy was standing  
And when I asked him why,  
He turned with eyes that could not see  
And he began to cry.  
  
I'm nobody's child,  
I'm nobody's child.  
Just like the flowers  
I'm growing wild.  
I got no mummy's kisses  
I got no daddy's smile.  
Nobody wants me,  
I'm nobody's child.  
  
No mummy's arms to hold me  
Or sue me when I cry,  
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome  
I wish that I could die.  
I'll walk the streets of heaven  
Where all blinds can see.  
  
And just like for the other kids  
It will be a home for me.  
  
I'm nobody's child,  
I'm nobody's child.  
Just like the flowers  
I'm growing wild.  
I got no mummy's kisses  
I got no daddy's smile.  
Nobody wants me,  
I'm nobody's child.
