I've seen  
I see you've turned your back on love again  
And I feel  
And I feel your stumbling down that road again  
  
And I feel  
Despair kissing our lips again  
And I feel  
Despair holding our hearts again, yeah  
  
Will you see  
Me crying behind your back again  
And you hear  
My heart beat slowly down again  
  
And I feel  
Despair kissing our lips again  
And I feel  
Despair holding our hearts again  
I feel  
Despair kissing our lips again  
And I feel  
Despair holding our hearts again, yeah

Despair kissing our lips again

Despair holding our hearts again, yeah  
  
Despair holding our hearts again, oho

Yeah

"Hear the silent song  
A moment have come before this.  
My heart, so violently beats along.  
Bleeding me to want to end it all.  
  
I weep for the dream in a dream.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
  
I read the words on torn down walls  
Reminding me how much I love you.  
  
I weep for the dream in a dream.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
I leave bleeding yet another day.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
It's all for you.  
It's all for you.  
  
Weep for the dream in a dream.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
I leave bleeding yet another day.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
It's all for you.  
It's all for you.  
It's all for you.

"Should've known how hard it is to stop tearing each other apart  
Separating souls entwined with all these labyrinthine lies  
  
I am dead to you, a shadow doomed  
My love, forever in the dark  
And of all untruths the truest is you  
Too close to my heart  
  
This emptiness I've made my home  
Embracing memories of dreams long gone  
One last caress from the corpse of love is all I want  
Underneath the cyanide sun  
  
We've sailed the seas of grief on a raft built with our tears  
Looking for a way to disappear for a moment from our deepest fears  
  
I'll be drowning you in this river of gloom  
Forever in my heart

"
"Shivers run through the spine  
Of hope as she cries  
the poison tears of her life delight  
In the raven black night  
Holding hands with  
  
Dark light  
Comes shine over all stars tonight  
And blind  
All fears that haunted you  
Your smile  
Dark Light  
  
In oblivious garden  
The bodies of fire  
Writhing to warmth the angel devine  
To learn how to die  
In peace with her heart  
  
Dark light  
Come shine over all stars tonight  
And blind  
All fears that haunted you  
Your smile  
Dark Light

"
"Despair has a face  
And all these wounds remain unhealed  
Blessed to kill and enslaved  
Are all hearts around love's will  
Thrilled to start all over again  
  
Crawl down dead lover's lane,  
The maze of memories stained  
And suck the blood right out of my heart  
  
Fear has a name  
Written on unhallowed ground  
With dead leaves  
Those words never fail  
To feed the hunger that dreams  
Our needs beyond God's grasp  
  
Crawl down dead lover's lane  
The maze of memories stained  
And suck the blood right out of my heart  
  
Scream out love's name in vain  
Embrace the pain again  
And lose yourself alone in the dark  
Dead lover's lane  
  
Crawl down dead lover's lane,  
The maze of memories stained  
And suck the blood right out of my heart  
  
Scream out love's name in vain  
Embrace the pain again  
And lose yourself alone in the dark  
  
And suck the blood right out of my heart  
  
Right out of my heart

"The promise of heaven pushed us right back to hell  
Turned three sevens into three sixes again  
And you laughed at my face when I told you how much it hurts  
And said  
  
Disarm me with your loneliness just like always before  
Deceive me out of my emptiness telling me how you love  
  
You keep on tempting me to go on whatever the cost  
To witness the prettiest flower in bloom wither to dust  
So I'll break all the rules in this endless game once called ""Love"" for you  
  
Disarm me with your loneliness just like always before and  
Deceive me out of my emptiness telling me how you love  
Me with all your heart no more  
  
Disarm me with your loneliness just like always before  
  
Disarm me with your loneliness just like always before  
Deceive me out of my emptiness telling me how you love me with all your heart
no more

"Softly the light shines in through  
The gates of grace on me and you  
Deceiving our restless hearts  
A flickering flame so serene  
Devours the night so we could see  
The fear we hold on to so strong  
  
But I know where I belong  
Away from your gods  
That heal all wounds  
And light this endless dark  
  
Lonely the light shines on you  
Through the gates of fire entombed  
Feeding on your love  
Weak is the blaze that kept me away  
From cruelty and tenderness embraced  
Saving my soul no more  
  
And I know where I belong  
Away from your gods  
That heal all wounds and light this endless dark  
That shine on you and tame your burning heart  
That bury my truth right into your arms  
That worship the tomb of our forlorn love

"I want to hold the hand inside you  
I want to take a breath that's true

I look to you to see the truth  
You live your life  
You go in shadows  
I look to you and I see nothing  
I look to you to see the truth  
  
Fade into you  
Strange you never knew  
Fade into you  
I think it's strange you never knew  
  
A stranger's light comes on slowly  
A stranger's heart without a home  
You put your hands into your head  
And then smiles cover your heart  
  
Fade into you  
Strange you never knew  
Fade into you  
I think it's strange you never knew  
  
Fade into you  
Strange you never knew  
Fade into you  
I think it's strange you never knew  
I think it's strange you never knew

"I love your skin oh so white  
I love your touch cold as ice  
And I love every single tear you cry  
I just love the way you're losing your life  
  
My Baby, how beautiful you are  
My Darling, completely torn apart  
You're gone with the sin my Baby and beautiful you are  
You're gone with the sin my Darling  
  
I adore the despair in your eyes  
I worship your lips once red as wine  
I crave for your scent sending shivers down my spine  
I just love the way you're running out of life

feels like i'm drowning without you

"Divided we stand in the light of a frozen sun  
Cursing the Gods we have become  
We steal the fire from a sacred heart  
And bleed the wine unholy  
We fall in love with the serpent's song  
And fear nothing  
  
In the nightside of Eden  
We're born again -  
Dead  
  
""Forever we are  
Forever we've been  
Forever will be crucified to a dream""  
  
Deranged we're tearing away the petals of desire  
Learning the mathematics of evil by heart  
We deceive ourselves to start a war  
Within the realm of senses  
And descend to the circle number four  
Where we are nothing  
  
In the nightside of Eden  
We're born again -  
Dead  
  
""Forever we are  
Forever we've been  
Forever will be crucified to a dream""

To the sound of a chalkboard symphony played with nails  
For what it's worth I don't wanna see you hurt anymore  
Than you have to

Dine on glass, wine on blood  
Baby, love the hard way  
Baudelaire in Braille  
Baby, love the harder way  
Once you lose yourself entomb  
I promise you love the hardest way  
  
Pretty like a flower on a tomb you are kissed  
blue by the last arrows of your sun  
Olly olly oxen free  
Hide and go weep  
Oh, no more  
Unless you want

Love the hardest way  
Love the hardest way

Still can't believe it, can't stand to leave it

Acting like fools  
  
Tried to fly and climbed too high  
We saw it all, we had to fall  
But I swear it's true, was all for you  
I swear it's true, was all for you  
  
Making love all the time,  
Never let the day go by, or a night  
Sweet music in the dark  
You always found the spark to light my light

For what I'm feeling

And the light is long gone  
And I wonder where you are

For what I'm feeling  
No love  
No love will be the end

In the drawing of the flame  
Making love to the rain

Come on ode to solitude in chains  
Here's to the pain as always heaven in flames now bleeding

Loosen the noose love loosen the noose with love  
What I want to know is why you keep me hanging

"It's poetry carved in flesh  
This beautiful hell of ours  
To the deadliest sin we confess  
(Tears of joy fill our eyes)  
We are safe where disfigured saints  
Cry out their prophecies of doom  
  
My heart's a graveyard, baby  
And to evil we make love  
On our passion's killing floor  
In my arms, you won't sleep safely  
And of lust we are reborn  
On our passion's killing floor  
  
At the first kiss  
the seeds of hatred are sown  
Back into darkness we flee  
(To tear our hearts out)  
We are saved where all faiths fail  
Alive inside of our tomb  
  
My heart's a graveyard, baby  
And to evil we make love  
On our passion's killing floor  
In my arms, you won't sleep safely  
And of lust we are reborn  
On our passion's killing floor  
  
My heart's a graveyard, baby

On our passion's killing floor  
In my arms, you won't sleep safely

My heart's a graveyard, baby

"A moth into a butterfly  
And a lie  
Into the sweetest truth  
I'm so afraid of life  
  
I try  
To call your name but I'm  
Silenced by the fear of dying in your heart once again  
  
I see the seasons changing  
And in the heart of this autumn I fall  
With the leaves from the trees  
  
I play dead  
To hide my heart  
Until the world gone dark fades away  
  
I cry  
Like God cries the rain  
And I'm just one step away from the end of today  
  
I see the reasons changing  
And in the warmth of the past I crawl  
Scorched by the shame  
  
I play dead  
To hide my heart  
Until the world gone dark fades away  
  
I stay dead  
Until you veil my scars and say goodbye to fate  
Before it's too late

Poison girl  
And love's heart is death

"[Ramones cover]  
  
No one ever thought this one would survive  
Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind  
Lock you in a dream, never let you go  
Never let you laugh or smile, not you  
  
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
  
Making friends with a homeless torn up man  
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up  
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay  
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday  
  
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
A poison heart  
A poison heart  
A poison heart  
Yeah  
  
You know that life really takes it's toll  
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul  
So much damn confusion before my eyes  
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
  
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
A poison heart  
A poison heart  
A poison heart  
A poison heart  
A poison heart  
A poison heart  
A poison heart

"Love is a flame that can't be tamed,  
And though we are its willing pray, my darling,  
We are not the ones to blame  
  
Trust is a word all lovers know,  
The glorious art of staining souls, my darling,  
We are not the ones to blame  
  
The more we have, the more we want,  
And the more it hurts our heart, my baby,  
It always ends up in tears  
  
So keep on Pretending  
Our heaven's worth the waiting  
Keep on Pretending  
It's all right  
So keep on Pretending  
It will be the end of our craving

It's all right  
  
When doubts arise the game begins  
The one we will never win, my baby,  
It always ends up in tears  
  
So keep on Pretending  
Our heaven's worth the waiting  
Keep on Pretending  
It's all right  
So keep on Pretending  
It will be the end of our craving

"I taste death in every kiss we share  
Every sundown seems to be the last we have  
Your breath on my skin has the scent of our end  
I'm drunk on your tears, Baby, can't you see it's hurting  
Every time we touch we get closer to heaven  
And at every sunrise our sins are forgiven  
Uh uh  
You on my skin this must be the end  
The only way you can love me ist to hurt me again  
And again  
  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Your love is a razor blade kiss  
Sweetest is the taste from your lips  
Oh the taste from your lips, my Darling  
Taste from your lips, oh my Love  
  
Only inside I'm free  
I'm tired of waiting  
You've got to let me dream  
Inside Baby  
I'm not afraid to feel  
I want your to love me  
Cause you are the one  
Cause you are the one  
Cause you are the one  
  
Your love is a razor blade kiss

"There was a time  
When I could breath my life in you  
One by one  
Your pale fingers started to move  
And I touched your face  
And all life was erased  
You smiled like an angel  
(falling from grace)  
  
We've been slaves to this love  
From the moment we touched  
And keep begging for more  
Of this resurrection  
  
We've been slaves to this love  
From the moment we touched  
And keep begging for more

You kissed my lips  
With those once cold fingertips  
You reached out for me  
And oh how you missed  
You touched my face  
And all life was erased  
You smiled like an angel  
(Falling from grace)  
  
We've been slaves to this love  
From the moment we touched

"She's smiling like heaven is down on earth  
Sun is shining so bright it hurts  
All her wishes have finally com true  
Her heart is weeping.  
Happiness is killing her.  
  
She'll be right here in my arms  
So in Love  
She'll be right here in these arms  
She can't let go  
She can't let go  
  
So hard she's trying  
But her heart won't turn to stone, oh no  
She keeps on crying  
But I won't leave her alone  
She'll never be alone  
  
She'll be right here in my arms

"Upon the wings of a dream she rides  
Oh, she comes to me, fills me with life  
Towards the dark side of the moon, we glide  
She sings me a tune on our way through the silvery starlight  
  
I don't wont to wake up this time  
I'm alive on this serpent ride  
  
In the grace of our love we writhe in pain  
Farther into the song I fall, mesmerized  
A drop of her blood tastes like wine  
I answer her call with a rhyme:  
  
""That is not dead which can eternal lie  
Yet with strange aeons death may die""  
  
In your eyes lies the world where I don't wanna go  
You said you'd changed, but I don't believe in miracles  
Since you conquered my heart we've never been apart  
One day we'll close our eyes, open them again  
And discover each other  
  
As I open up my eyes she greets me with a smile  
From her wrists flows wine

"
"Sigillum Diaboli  
I can't see as I'm facing your pitiful lies  
Don't have the strength to carry your heavy load of life  
I'm your Christ and I want you  
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do  
  
Oh  
I can't see through your eyes, bring your tears on me  
I will lift the burden from your shoulders just to have killing  
I'm your Christ and I want you

"I hid the keys to unlock love's heart  
To hold you in my sweetest pain and suffering  
Everything's unfair in our lust and war  
Redemption beyond right and wrong  
  
In our hearts love keeps sweet-talking to despair  
And goes on sleepwalking past hope  
All is lost in this war  
And all we can do is to wail and weep to the saddest song  
Sleepwalking past hope  
  
I unlit the light to embrace the dark  
To be near but not to turn into you my darling  
Forever we're lost in our souls' storm  
Reflections of each other's faults  
  
I gave up long ago  
Painting love with crimson flow  
Ran out of blood and hope  
So I paint you no more  
  
My hell begins from the 10th and descends to the circle  
Six hundred threescore and six  
And from there I crawl beneath Lucifer's claws just for one last kiss

"
"There's a flame that leads all souls astray  
No one's safe from its tender touch of pain  
Everyday it's looking for new slaves  
To celebrate the beauty of the grave  
  
We are like the living dead  
Sacrificing all we have  
For a frozen heart and a soul on fire  
We are like the living dead  
Craving for deliverance  
With a frozen heart and a soul on fire  
  
Again we're falling for disgrace  
And hate will shelter us from the rain  
We are enslaved by the sacred heart of shame  
And gently raped by the light of day  
  
Addicted to our divine despair  
The venom of the cross we bear  
The guilt will follow us to death

"
"Watching every motion  
In my foolish lover's game  
On this endless ocean  
Finally lover's know no shame  
Turning and returning  
To some secret place inside  
Watching in slow motion  
As you turn around and say  
  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
Watching, I keep waiting  
Still anticipating love  
Never hesitating  
To become the fated ones  
Turning and returning  
To some secret place inside  
Watching in slow motion  
As you turn to me and say  
My love...  
  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
Through the hourglass I saw you  
In time you slipped away  
When the mirror crashed I called you  
And turned to hear you say  
If only for today  
I am unafraid  
  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
Watching every motion  
In this foolish lover's game  
Haunted by a notion  
Somewhere there's a love in this place  
Turning and returning  
To some secret place inside  
Watching in slow motion  
As you turn away and say  
  
Take my breath away  
My love  
Take my breath away  
My love  
Take my breath away  
My love  
Take my breath away

"With the fire from the fireworks up above me  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand  
You run for cover in the Temple of Love  
You run for another, but still the same  
For the wind will blow my name across this land  
In the Temple of Love you hide together  
Believing pain and fear outside  
But someone near you rides the weather  
And the tears he cried will rain on  
Walls as wide as lovers' eyes  
  
In the Temple of Love: Shine like thunder  
In the Temple of Love: Cry like rain  
In the Temple of Love: Hear my calling  
In the Temple of Love: Hear my name

My guardian angel walks away  
Life is short and love is always over in the morning  
Black wind come carry me far away  
With the sunlight died and night above me  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside  
You run for cover in the Temple of Love  
You run for another, it's all the same  
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside  
  
With the fire from the fireworks up above  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain  
You run for cover in the Temple of Love  
Shine like thunder, cry like rain  
And the Temple of Love grows old and strong  
But the wind blows stronger, cold and long  
And the Temple of Love will fall before this  
Black wind calls my name to you no more  
  
In the black sky thunder sweeping under  
Ground and over water sounds of  
Crying weeping will not save your  
Faith for bricks and dreams for mortar  
All your prayers must seem as nothing  
Ninety-six below the wave when  
Stone is dust and only air remains  
  
In the Temple of Love: Shine like thunder  
In the Temple of Love: Cry like rain  
In the Temple of Love: Hear the calling  
And the Temple of Love is falling  
Down  
  
In the Temple of Love: Shine like thunder  
In the Temple of Love: Cry like rain  
In the Temple of Love: Hear my calling

Crying weeping will not save your  
Faith for bricks and dreams for mortar

Only haven you can trust, and the  
Devil in a black dress watches over

"By your heart strings I'm hanging from a dream,  
Gently swinging in the warm autumn breeze.  
  
Come look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up, no more.  
  
Tip toeing along a strand of your hair suspended between,  
These thoughts and actions miles above reality.

Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.

She tries to hide but she can't  
(whoa oh oh)  
Looking for an advantage  
Cause he is too far gone  
  
Fighting the light that shines in through the window  
Running away from what she don't know  
Breaking away from the streak that she can't hide from  
But theres not enough time to love  
(her love is too long)  
  
Again her stays restless  
As she hides in the dark  
Waiting for the light to break through  
As the wall begins to fall  
(oh it's so strong)  
  
Fighting the light that shines in through the window  
Running away from what she don't know  
Breaking away from the streak that she can't hide from  
But theres not enough time to love  
(her love is too long)  
  
How is her love so strong  
No one can break the wall  
Trying so hard to win her  
There is too long to love

While the ice gives way under my feet  
And so I drown with the sun  
  
I've been been burning in water and drowning in flame  
To prove you wrong and scare you away  
I have never minded the one back home  
Your heart under the rose  
  
I open my eyes with a sigh of relief  
As the warmth of summer sunlight dances around me  
That's you with the leaves in your hands  
  
I've been been burning in water and drowning in flame  
To prove you wrong and scare you away  
I have never minded the one back home  
Your heart under the rose
