"All my life I've been searching for something  
Something never comes never leads to nothing  
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close  
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope  
All night long I dream of the day  
  
When it comes around and it's taken away  
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most  
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost  
  
Calm down don't you resist  
You've such a delicate wrist  
And if I give it a twist  
Something to hold when I lose my grip  
Will I find something in there  
To give me just what I need  
Another reason to bleed  
One by one hidden up my sleeve (one by one hidden up my sleeve)  
  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down  
  
Will I find a believer  
Another one who believes  
Another one to deceive  
Over and over down on my knees  
If I get any closer  
And if you open up wide  
And if you let me inside  
On and on I've got nothing to hide (on and on I've got nothing to hide)  
  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down

Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close  
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

When it comes around and it's taken away  
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most  
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one

They're not dumb, they were so wrong

Metronome

Breathe for me when I'm gone  
Burn out beyond  
Out beyond the sun

There behind the skies  
Walking on the embers  
Standing in their light  
The hardest part is knowing  
Everything must die  
The hardest part is waiting here  
Waiting to collide

"Where you off to with that head of yours  
Is there somewhere you should be

And told you it's not you, it's only me, baby

(Give me back my piece of mind)  
Don't say what I don't mean

But honestly

Don't say what I don't mean

No where to hide from me

And tonight I thank the stars  
As I count my lucky scars  
For everything you've given me  
And all the words I gave to you  
Something borrowed something blue  
If you want them back  
I'll give it to you  
Give it to you

Is butterflies  
  
I'm all sick for you

You're the one that bothers me  
I am not a fool  
You're the one pretending to be

Rare pelicans  
In wonderland

"Once I rose above the noise and confusion  
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion  
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high  
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man  
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man  
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin',  
I can hear them say  
  
Carry on wayward son,  
For there'll be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Now don't you cry no more  
  
Masquerading as a man with a reason  
My charade is the event of the season  
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely  
Means that I don't know  
On a stormy sea of moving emotion  
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean  
I set a course for winds of fortune, but  
I hear the voices say  
  
Carry on, you will always remember  
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor  
Now your life's no longer empty  
Surely heaven waits for you

"
"It was meant to be  
But all along it never meant a thing  
Never stopped to ask you why  
You didn't pass me by  
Did you see me in your life  
Flash before your eyes  
Was it just that I wasn't hard enough  
Hard enough for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Stop using my  
Confusion  
Wait, wait  
There's a world out there  
Don't you deny me  
Give me one last wish  
There's a world out there  
  
Elementary  
I solved them all  
All your mysteries  
Settle down and in good time  
We can solve all mine  
Tell me lies or tell me when  
Tear me up again  
And I will let you know  
When I've had enough  
Had enough of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know you've got your reasons  
Hey let's call it even  
Turn out all the lights and go to bed  
Still I get this feeling  
No one will believe me  
When I let these ghosts outside my head  
  
There's a world out there  
Don't you deny me  
Give me one last wish  
Don't you deny me  
  
There's a world out there  
Don't you deny me  
Give me one last wish  
There's a world out there

"I knew a girl named Nikki  
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend  
I met her in a hotel lobby  
Masturbating with a magazine  
  
She said how'd you like to waste some time  
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind  
  
She took me to her castle  
And I just couldn't believe my eyes  
She had so many devices  
Everything that money could buy  
She said sign your name on the dotted line  
The lights went out  
And Nikki started to grind  
  
Ahh!  
Nikki!  
Oh  
  
The castle started spinning  
Or maybe it was my brain  
I can't tell you what she did to me  
But my body will never be the same  
Her lovin' will kick your behind  
Oh, she'll show you no mercy  
But she'll sho' 'nough sho' 'nough show you how to grind  
  
Woke up the next morning  
Nikki wasn't there  
I looked all over and all I found  
Was a phone number on the stairs  
It said thank you for a funky time  
Call me up whenever you want to grind  
  
Ah!  
Nikki!  
Oh  
Ah!  
Come back Nikki!  
Come back!

Sing along my soul today  
Sing along another song for you

What does it matter

No one has a fit like I do

Whisper for the days gone by  
Whisper with the voice inside of you  
With this ring you will be mine  
With this ring I'll multiply  
With this ring surrendering to you  
What's a boy to do?

The machine and play kill by numbers  
Down in the park with a friend called five  
I was in a car crash or was it the war  
But I never been quite the same  
Little white lies like I was there  
  
Come to tom-tom's the place to eat  
Like it was built in one day  
You can wath the humans trying to run  
Oh look, there's a rape machine  
I'd go outside if it'd look the other way  
Wouldn't believe the things they do  
  
Down in the park  
Where the chant is death, death, death  
Til' sun cries morning  
Down in the park with friends of mine  
We are not lovers, we are not romantics  
We are here to serve  
Different face but the words never change

Will you call them freaks  
Or will you call them gods  
Will you call them freaks  
  
You know you sperm is weak  
You never looked, so high  
To ever find her so low  
You did not have to go, that far  
To show her you were holy  
  
Now you know they're gonna come for you  
And drag your silly name into the mud  
If the mother bears your children without tears  
And without the usual costs of labor  
  
Will you call her a freak  
Will you call them freaks  
Or will you call them gods  
Will you call them freaks

Gather them all we'll bury them deep

"He needs a quiet room  
With a lock to keep him  
In its just a quiet room  
And he's there  
He plays an old guitar  
With a coin found by the phone  
It was his friends guitar  
That he played  
Hm mm mm  
  
He's never been in love  
But he knows just what love is  
He says never mind  
And no one speaks  
  
He thinks he drinks too much  
Cause when he tells his two best friends  
I think I drink too much  
  
No one speaks  
No one speaks

Wish I could stay sick with you

You can call it whatever  
Eating deep inside of you

Steal me now and forever

Send me out on a tether  
Swing it round

I'm making you volunteer  
Another one has come and gone  
They crawl along  
Make them disappear

Tired of wearing black and blue  
Dress me up in stitches  
It's now or never  
Tired of wearing black and blue

Blood on you  
  
Take another stab at me  
I promise in time I'll heal  
But yesterday went on and on a bit too long  
I waited out on high street  
There's nothing to find out here  
Another day has come and gone  
They crawl along  
Wasting all these years  
  
Dress me up in stitches  
It's now or never  
Tired of wearing black and blue  
Dress me up in stitches  
It's now or never  
Tired of wearing black and blue

How can you go on  
When you're murdering someone  
Killing me like you do  
  
Gimme stitches  
Now or never  
  
Before I get my blood on you

"Since I'm putting down all of the true things around, but I like it  
I handed down the crown, given the jewels and the answers of may  
The thought of being ousted comes and goes  
When I think about it the wind blows  
I hate it  
  
Run me out of town, somewhere a move might intended a gown at  
Pissed at all the bowels, always the blues and a delicate smile  
Missed all of the sideways, gull and noun  
Chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around  
I hate it  
  
Good grief

You ain't strong enough

Pray you're gonna make it  
And then when you're done  
You keep fucking up  
One day soon I'll disappear  
And if you'll come I'll take you somewhere to go  
To keep from growing old  
  
Wait and pray you'll pick on me

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy,  
We call it Riding the Gravy Train.

We heard about the sell out.  
You gotta get an album out.  
You owe it to the people.  
We're so happy we can hardly count.  
  
Everyone else is just green,

And I will lead the choir  
Sing farewell  
See you in hell  
  
Come break, my spell  
Well down the wishing well  
We'll find some time to kill  
  
I'll be, right there  
The buzz inside your head  
The whole electric chair  
See you in hell  
  
We'll gather round the fire  
And I don't need the choir  
Sing farewell  
See you in hell

Angels that hover above  
Eyes that can change from blind to blue

Throw it away long before

For a year or two  
And you know youve seen it all  
In daddys car

Back east your type don't crawl  
  
Play ethnicky jazz  
To parade your snazz  
On your five grand stereo  
Braggin that you know  
How the brothers feel cold  
And the slums got so much soul  
  
It's time to taste what you most fear  
Right guard will not help you here  
Brace yourself, my dear  
Brace yourself, my dear  
  
It's a holiday in cambodia  
It's tough, kid, but it's life  
It's a holiday in cambodia  
Don't forget to pack a wife  
  
You're a star-belly sneech  
You suck like a leach  
You want everyone to act like you  
Kiss ass while you bitch  
So you can get rich  
But your boss gets richer off you  
  
Well you'll work harder  
With a gun in your back  
For a bowl of rice a day  
Slave for soldiers  
Till you starve  
Then your head is skewered on a stake  
  
Now you can go where people are one  
Now you can go where they get things done  
What you need, my son  
What you need, my son  
  
Is a holiday in cambodia  
Where people dress in black  
A holiday in cambodia  
Where you'll kiss ass or crack  
  
Pol Pot  
  
And it's a holiday in cambodia  
Where you'll do what you're told  
A holiday in cambodia  
Where the slums got so much soul

"Wish I were with you, but I couldn't stay  
Every direction leads me away  
Pray for tomorrow, but for today  
All I want, is to be home  
  
Stand in the mirror, you look the same  
Just looking for shelter, from the cold and the pain  
Someone to cover, safe from the rain  
And all I want, is to be home  
  
The echoes and silence, patience and grace  
And all of these moments I'll never replace  
Fear of my heart absence of faith  
All I want, is to be home  
  
All I want, is to be home  
  
People I've loved, have no regrets  
Some might remember, some might forget  
Some of them livin', some of them dead  
All I want, is to be home

"We sat and watched a new day melt 'til dawn  
Had my share of memories, now it's time to move on  
Another lonley lesson never turned out wrong  
These things I've done without you - should have never been done  
Call on me and I'll shout down...  
  
How do you do when I'm not around?  
  
I've never felt this wrong and now I know  
This love was burnin' thru me though it never did show  
Let's spend 2 lives together kissing the stars below  
We're hot inside each other - never let you go  
Call on me and I'll shout down...  
  
Call on me and I'll shout down...

"[Verse 1]  
There is a secret, I found a secret  
Behind a SoHo door  
There is a reason, I found a reason  
Beneath the subway floor  
I found the water, the devil's water  
And walked along its shore  
  
[Break-Down 1]  
Is that what you want?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Your channel's changing, the heart is racing  
From voices on the wire  
The soul is yearning, the coal is burning  
The ember starts a fire  
Can we recover love for each other?  
The measure of your life  
  
[Break-Down 2]  
Is that what you want?  
Is that what you really want?

A river running underground  
A river, a river  
Is that what you want?

It returns and when it lands words are due

You were too

"So we were in Amsterdam  
And we were staying at this guy  
Toss's house  
Good friend of ours  
Uhh  
Its kinda in the middle of the city  
We were just finished with our  
Second European tour  
And everything was going pretty good  
Skeeter, he met this girl that lived  
Next door to Toss's  
And within a couple of weeks he started  
Living with her, you know?  
And I guess she had a lot of money or something  
Cause she was constantly buying him clothes  
And getting him lots of stuff and loading him  
With money, you know?  
He was constantly going to the coffee shop  
Always getting the best herb and the best  
Hash, you know?  
He was in good shape  
She was really good looking, she was  
Really cool  
I, I don't think he'd ever met her before  
But she had, you know, other boyfriends I suppose  
So I'm sitting on the couch, you know, in  
Toss's apartment  
And I'm reading, you know, maximum rock and  
Roll or flip side  
One of those punk things  
And I heard Skeeter come in  
And he came in and he had all these really  
Nice clothes on  
She bought him all this stuff  
She like bought him cologne  
He was really really smelling good, you know  
He looked good too  
You know he came in and put his herb  
On the table and, whatever  
I'm just reading my little punk magazine  
Not really paying attention  
And then he says, uh, he says hey dave  
And I look up  
And he's standing there with his dick  
In his hand  
And he's kinda got it like lifted up so  
He's looking at the head of his dick  
He kinda pointed it at me  
I didn't know what to think  
He said does that look like pus to you  
I said no I think it's lint

"Looking out a dirty old window  
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by  
I sit here alone and I wonder why  
  
Friday night and everyone's moving  
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down  
I search for the beat in this dirty town  
  
Downtown the young ones are going  
Downtown the young ones are growing

Hot-shot, give me no problems

Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right  
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight

"It gets loneliest at night.  
Down at the liquor store.  
Beneath the neon sky.  
Our moonlight.  
Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice.  
The pan's dried up so tight.  
With hardened beans.  
We're hungry.  
So I lean on you sometimes.  
Just to see you're still there.  
Your feet can't take the weight of one.  
Much less two.  
We hit concrete.  
How were we born into this mess?  
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby.  
But we were run out on a rail.  
Fell from the wagon to the night train.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
Cigarettes they fill the gaps.  
In our empty days.  
In our broken teeth.  
We're jonesing.  
Say mister, can you spare a dime?  
Some change could make a change.  
Could buy some time.  
Some freedom.  
Or an ear to hear my story.  
It's all I've got. My fiction  
Beats the hell out of my truth.  
A palm upturned burnt blue.  
Don't call it sunburn.  
You've been shaking on the job.  
Just one drink ahead of your past.  
There's a white light coming up.  
You draw the blinds hoping it'll pass.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.

And oh, why can't we let it be  
And see through the hole in this wall of confusion  
I just can't help the feeling  
I'm living a life of illusion  
  
Pow! Right between the eyes  
Oh, how nature loves her little surprises  
Wow, it all seems so logical now  
It's just one of her better disguises  
And it comes with no warning  
Nature loves her little surprises  
Continual crisis  
  
Hey, don't you know it's a waste of your day  
Caught up in endless solutions  
That have no meaning, just another hunch  
Based upon jumping conclusions  
Endless solutions  
Backed up against a wall of confusion

I'm living a life of illusion  
I'm living a life of illusion

Imagine the day, I'm drowing that they can reel me in  
Pick up where I left off

I'm scratchin around, it's getting too loud the space I'm in  
  
So now I can leave, Too decent of me so evident

"Crazy but I believe this time  
Begging for sweet relief  
A blessing in disguise  
Dying behind these tired eyes  
I've been losing sleep  
Please come to me tonight  
  
Hands on a miracle  
I've got my hands on a miracle  
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle  
And there ain't no way  
That you'd it away  
  
Everything that we survived  
It's gonna be alright  
Just lucky we're alive  
Got no vision I've been blind  
Searching every where  
You're right here in my sight

"I can't wait til it's light out,  
There's some things I should get them done,  
Tried inhaling some white out,  
Ended up with some bleeding gums.  
  
Anything I left in the closet,  
Shouldn't have a hard time getting out,  
If I had the time I could make it,  
Seems to be the chances are chasing,  
  
All the substance I've done without,  
And all the luck that I've hated,  
Aside from all of the petty doubt,  
Can't believe I have made it.  
  
I'm afraid of the dark now,  
It's the sign of a patsy,  
Round the time of the door brow,  
We should let it come in,  
  
Never put your face in the water,  
It hurts your eyes when they open up,  
Not that any different could matter,  
It's just a different conspirit.  
  
If there's one thing I could laugh about,  
Solve this mess I've created,  
I've tried a part of the sacred cow,  
  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you

Threw it up as it went down  
Strange enough it left me rude and turned around

Always waited for my turn

Washed them in the muddy water

And wait for you to come through the door  
  
Oh maybe maybe maybe  
I can share it with you  
I behave I behave I behave  
So I can share it with you  
  
You were not alone  
Dear loneliness  
You forgot  
But I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
  
I am not alone  
Dear loneliness  
I forgot  
That I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
We'll dream about somewhere  
Our smoke will fill the air  
As I lay awake and wait  
For you to walk out that door  
I can change I can change I can change  
But who do you want me to be  
I'm the same I'm the same I'm the same  
Oh do you want me to be  
  
You were not alone  
Dear loneliness  
You forgot  
But I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
I'm not alone  
Dear loneliness  
I forgot  
That I remember this  
You were not alone  
Dear loneliness  
You forgot  
But I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
  
I'm not alone  
Dear loneliness  
I forgot  
That I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh

"I've got another confession to make  
I'm your fool  
Everyone's got their chains to break  
Holdin' you  
  
Were you born to resist or be abused?  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
  
Are you gone and onto someone new?  
I needed somewhere to hang my head  
Without your noose  
You gave me something that I didn't have  
But had no use  
I was too weak to give in  
Too strong to lose  
My heart is under arrest again  
But I break loose  
My head is giving me life or death  
But I can't choose  
I swear I'll never give in  
I refuse  
  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
Has someone taken your faith?  
Its real, the pain you feel  
You trust, you must  
Confess  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
Oh  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Has someone taken your faith?  
Its real, the pain you feel  
The life, the love  
You die to heal  
The hope that starts  
The broken hearts  
You trust, you must  
Confess  
  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
  
I've got another confession my friend  
I'm no fool  
I'm getting tired of starting again  
Somewhere new  
  
Were you born to resist or be abused?  
I swear I'll never give in  
I refuse  
  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
Has someone taken your faith?  
Its real, the pain you feel  
You trust, you must  
Confess  
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  
Oh

"Visiting is pretty  
Visiting is good  
Seems that all they ever wanted was a brother  
  
This can be a secret  
We can keep it good  
Even all the ever wanting had a problem  
  
This is a call to all my  
Past resignations  
It's been too long  
  
Fingernails are pretty  
Fingernails are good  
Seems that all they ever wanted was a marking  
  
Them balloons are pretty big  
And say they should  
Ever fall to ground  
Call the magic marker  
  
This is a call to all my  
Past resignations  
This is a call to all  
This is a call to all my  
Past resignations  
It's been too long  
  
Minicyn is pretty  
Minicyn is good  
Seems that all the cysts and mollusks tend to barter  
  
Ritalin is easy  
Ritalin is good  
Even all the ones  
Who watered down the daughter

"What's there at the door that changed my life  
Without a simple reason why  
Feel another afternoon  
Split my poor broken heart in two  
It's not a friend that you and I  
Throwing needles at the sky  
March with friends that's you today  
Put them on and walked away  
  
I walked away  
I walked away  
I walked away  
  
You laughed the while you kissed my head  
Talk about the time we spent  
Picking arms up from the sand  
Sure to never never land  
In the middle of my story  
Fuel the bed to keep you warm  
Lie around and beat my head  
Feed the cactus, i'm instead  
  
Get lost instead  
Get lost instead  
Get lost instead  
  
The end....  
The end....  
The end!

I'm the one that drives away  
Then follows you back home  
I am a street light shining  
I'm a wild light blinding bright  
Burning off alone

It's times like these you give and give again  
It's times like these you learn to love again  
It's times like these time and time again  
  
I am a new day rising  
I'm a brand new sky  
To hang the stars upon tonight  
I am a little divided  
Do I stay or run away  
And leave it all behind?  
  
It's times like these you learn to live again  
It's times like these you give and give again  
It's times like these you learn to love again

Waiting for the day I have to choose  
Cursed by love so dire

One more boy to lend a hand to you

"(this isn't a foo fighters song, it's by gomez)  
Once apon a time,  
Not too long ago,  
We took a day out in Manchester,  
We all fall down,  
There's not enough hours in our day.  
Played a bit of football,  
Fell into the union,  
Barged our way into the toilets,  
With the kung foo king,  
There's not enough hours in our day.  
  
I remember seeing someone  
Dressed in a suit,  
Looking like a lunatic,  
And we all fall down,  
There's not enough hours in our trip.  
Well, academy cartwheels  
Breakin' your hands,  
We got lovely posters for sale,  
And we all fall down,  
There's not enough hours in our day.  
  
We like lovin' yeah, and the wine we share,  
We like lovin' yeah, and the wine we share.  
  
Finally made our way,  
Back to the train,  
Rollin' into Sheffield tonight,  
We all fall down,  
There's not enough hours in our life,  
Try and lose my way  
And wait at the station,  
We're whippin' Picadilly tonight,  
And it all falls down,  
Theres not enough hours in our life.  
  
We like lovin' yeah, and the wine we share,  
We like lovin' yeah, and the wine we share.

"I'll take you out of the wishin' well  
I thinkin' I have a plan  
Go with your bad self  
Why did you cheat yourself?  
You think you're losing  
China's not accusing  
You never gonna take a hit on the head  
Now if you don't care  
Take a ride somewhere  
  
Hey you got something  
You gotta try and buy our soul  
Hey you got something  
It goes round and round again  
Go, go, you should've never waste your lung  
Go, go, and the ride was shared  
Go limo, go limo  
  
I got you stuck in the habit trail  
You've grown to lovin' this shit  
Way out on a back shelf  
Yeah you don't know what you've done  
Look what you're doin'  
Now mama says it's ruined  
You've got a mollusk in the palm of your hand  
So it's a bad smell  
Your eyes wanna win  
  
Hey you got something  
You wanna try and buy our soul  
Hey you got something  
It goes round and round and round again  
Go, go, you're never having to waste your lung  
Go, go, and the ride was shared  
Go, go, whatever happened to Day-Glo Jones?  
Go, go, and the ride was shared  
Go limo, go limo

"I have a choice between the bat or the belt  
Each time I hear about the hand you've been dealt  
Spare me confessions, it's confession you sell  
Maybe I'll fall behind, I don't mind 'cause I'll catch up!  
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,  
I hope you never see me wind up  
  
Will I be happy on the back of the shelf?  
Will you be happy when we're sharing a cell?  
Spare me the questions since you know me so well  
Someday you'll realize I get shy and I choke up!  
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,  
I hope you never see me wind up  
What is wrong with this animal?  
I'm terrible  
I hope you never see me wind up  
  
Farewell, my sweet paramania  
Farewell, my sweet paramania  
My only promise is that I'll never tell  
Keep you at a distance from the things that I felt  
I'll bite the bullet, take the beating until  
I take it all back anyway.  
  
What was I supposed to say?  
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,  
I hope you never see me wind up  
What is wrong with this animal?  
I'm terrible  
I hope you never see me wind up
