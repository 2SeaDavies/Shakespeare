"You scare me a bit,  
But that's all right  
You know when I want you  
Most every night  
  
And I've been meaning to tell  
You baby that it makes no sense  
Still I'm finally convinced  
Yeah yeah  
  
I believe we could chug all night  
I believe we could hug all night  
The band is loose and the groove  
Is right you're so much woman I  
  
Believe we could chug all night  
On the day that I die, well  
I just might scream  
If I'm alive in the morning  
  
I'll be alive in a dream  
You better listen to me baby  
Cause you know that I'm hung on you  
Till I'm blind and black and blue  
  
No one else will do  
I do believe we chug all night  
I believe we could hug all night  
The band is loose and the groove is right  
  
You're so much woman I believe  
We could chug all night  
No woman ever do what you do  
High on a pleasure wheel  
  
No devil ever cast a voodoo  
So long and dark and real  
We're gonna do a little chugging  
We're gonna do a little hugging  
  
The band is loose and the groove is right  
I'm wired for sound  
Are you wired for light?  
And you're so much woman,  
  
I believe we could chug all night  
I said a yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Woo! it's only midnight baby  
Come on and do it to me

"They were doolin', doolin'-dalton  
High or low, it was the same  
Easy money, and faithless women  
Red eye whiskey for the pain.  
  
Go down little dalton, it must be God's will  
Two brothers lyin' dead in Coffeeville.  
Two voices call to you from where they stood,  
""Lay down your law books now, they're no damn good.""  
  
Better keep on movin', doolin'-dalton  
Till your shadow sets you free.  
And if you're fast, and if you're lucky,  
You will never see that hangin' tree.  
  
Well the towns lay out across the dusty plain  
Like graveyards filled with tombstones waitin' for the names  
And a man could use his back or use his brains  
But some just went stir-crazy Lord cause nothin' ever changed  
  
Till they're doolin' Neville Dalton  
He was workin' cheap, just buyin' time  
And then he laughed and said I'm goin'  
And so he left that peaceful life behind

"
"I don't know what you say  
Every single holy day,  
Never in my life I see  
How can it be, what's it for me?  
  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
Every what's his name  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
What, how can it be?  
Taking a tumble you know a tumble that you take a tumble  
(Its not like this)  
Cos I'm falling down the stairs, Help me cos I've got no grip, oh help me
please  
(And I fall)  
  
She left me, I can't see  
I'm blind  
Help me I'm so strong  
And then I lose my mind  
I want to be there but you cannot see me, with I know what's in your head  
  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
Every what's his name  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
What, how can it be?  
Taking a tumble you know a tumble that you take a tumble  
(Its not like this)  
Cos I'm falling down the stairs, Help me cos I've got no grip  
(And I fall)

"I wish you peace when the cold winds blow  
Warmed by the fire's glow  
I wish you comfort in the, the lonely time  
And arms to hold you when you ache inside  
  
I wish you hope when things are going bad  
Kind words when times are sad  
I wish you shelter from the, the raging wind  
Cooling waters at the fever's end  
  
I wish you peace when times are hard  
The light to guide you through the dark  
And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low  
  
I wish you the strength to let love grow on  
I wish you the strength to let love flow  
  
I wish you peace when times are hard  
A light to guide you through the dark  
And when storms are high and your, you dreams are low  
I wish you the strength to let let grown on  
I wish you the strength to let love flow on  
I wish you the strength to let love glow on  
I wish you the strength to let love go

"A perfect day, the sun is sinkin' low  
As evening falls, the gentle breezes blow  
The time we shared went by so fast  
Just like a dream, we knew it couldn't last  
But I'd do it all again  
If I could, somehow  
But I must be leavin' soon  
It's your world now  
  
It's your world now  
My race is run  
I'm moving on  
Like the setting sun  
No sad goodbyes  
No tears allowed  
You'll be alright  
It's your world now  
  
Even when we are apart  
You'll always be in my heart  
When dark clouds appear in the sky  
Remember true love never dies  
  
But first a kiss, one glass of wine  
Just one more dance while there's still time  
My one last wish: someday, you'll see  
How hard I tried and how much you meant to me  
  
It's your world now  
Use well the time  
Be part of something good  
Leave something good behind  
The curtain falls  
I take my bow  
That's how it's meant to be  
It's your world now  
It's your world now  
It's your world now

"James Dean, James Dean, I know just what you mean.  
James Dean, you said it all so clean  
And I know my life would look alright  
If I could see it on the silver screen.  
  
You were the low down rebel if there ever was  
Even if you had no cause.  
James dean, you said it all so clean  
And I know my life would look alright  
If I could see it on the silver screen.  
  
We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator,  
You were just too cool for school.  
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop,  
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules.  
  
James Dean, James Dean, so hungry and so lean.  
James Dean, you said it all so clean  
And I know my life would look alright  
If I could see it on the silver screen.  
  
Little James Dean up on the screen  
Wonderin' who he might be.  
Along came a spyder, picked up a rider,  
Took him down the road to eternity.  
  
James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen.  
James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen.  
You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye bye.  
You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye bye.  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Too fast to live too young to die  
Oo-oo-oo-oo too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Oh, James Dean too fast to live too young to die

"I have a mansion  
Forget the price  
Ain't never been there  
They tell me it's nice  
  
I live in hotels  
Tear out the walls  
I have accountants  
Pay for it all  
  
They say I'm crazy but I have a good time  
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime  
Life's been good to me so far  
  
My Maserati  
Does one eighty-five  
I lost my license  
Now I don't drive  
  
I have a limo  
Ride in the back  
I lock the doors  
In case I'm attacked  
  
I'm making records  
My fans they can't wait  
They write me letters  
Tell me I'm great  
  
So I got me an office  
Gold records on the wall  
Ust leave a message  
Maybe I'll call  
  
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through  
(Everybody sing) I'm cool (He's cool)  
I can't complain but sometimes I still do  
Life's been good to me so far  
  
I go to parties  
Sometimes until four  
It's hard to leave  
When you can't find the door  
  
It's tough to handle  
This fortune and fame  
Everybody's so different  
I haven't changed  
  
They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time  
(Everybody sing) Oh yeah (Oh yeah)  
I keep on going guess I'll never know why  
Life's been good to me so far baby,  
Inside the Sad Cafe.

"Tell me the truth, how do you feel?  
Like you're rollin' so fast that you're spinnin' your wheels?  
Don't feel too bad, you're not all along  
We're all tryin' to get along  
  
With ev'rybody else try'n' to go their way  
You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say?  
Just go along 'til they turn out the lights  
There's nothin' we can do to fight it  
  
No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain  
And we who must remain go on living just the same  
  
I once knew a man, very talented guy  
He's sing for the people and people would cry  
They knew that his song came from deep down inside  
You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes  
  
And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone  
Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind  
Called him home  
  
My man's got it made  
He's gone far beyond the pain  
And we who must remain go on living just the same  
We who must remain go on laughing just the same

"I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son  
The highway is my legacy  
On the highway I will run  
In one hand I've a Bible  
  
In the other I've got a gun  
Well, don' you know me  
I'm the man who won  
Woman don't try to love me  
  
Don't try to understand  
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man  
  
First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe  
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day  
All of my friends are strangers,  
They quickly come and go  
  
And all my love's in danger,  
'Cause I steal hearts and souls  
Woman, don't try to love me  
Don't try to understand A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man  
oo....  
  
Woman, don't try to love me  
Don't try to understand  
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man  
  
Some me call me Abel,  
Some men call me Cain,  
Some men call me sinner, Lord  
Some men call me saint  
  
Some say there's a Jesus  
Some men say there ain't  
When you got no life to lose  
Then there's nothin' left to gain  
Outlaw man  
Outlaw man

"I like the way sparkling earrings lay  
Upon your skin so brown  
And I want to sleep with you in the desert night  
With a million stars all around  
  
I get a peaceful easy feelin'  
And I know you won't let me down  
'Cause I'm already standin'  
On the ground  
  
And I found out a long time ago  
What a woman can do to your soul  
Aw but she can't take you any way  
You don't already know how to go  
  
I get a peaceful easy feelin'  
And I know you won't let me down  
'Cause I'm already standin'  
On the ground  
  
I get this feelin' I may know you  
As a lover and a friend  
This voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear  
Tells me I may never see you again  
  
I get a peaceful easy feelin'  
And I know you won't let me down  
'Cause I'm already standin'  
Yes I'm already standin'  
Yes I'm already standin'  
On the ground

"Bells will be ringing this sad sad New Years  
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues  
My baby's gone I have no friends  
To wish me greetings once again  
Cries will be singing Silent Night  
Christmas carols by candlelight  
Please come home for Christmas  
Please come home for Christmas  
If not for Christmas by New Years night  
Friends and relations send salutations  
Sure as the stars shine above  
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear  
The time of year to be with the ones you love  
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam  
Christmas and new Years will find you home  
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain  
And I'll be happy, happy once again  
Oh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain  
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again

"Hi there, how are 'ya?  
It's been a long time  
Seems like we've come a long way  
My, but we learn so slow  
And heroes, they come and they go  
And leave us behind as if  
We're supposed to know why  
  
Why do we give up our hearts to the past?  
And why must we grow up so fast?  
  
And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes  
Someone should send you a rose  
With love from a friend,  
It's nice to hear from you again  
And the storybook comes to a close  
Gone are the ribbons and bows  
Things to remember, places to go  
Pretty maids all in a row  
  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo

"There are stars in the southern sky  
Southward as you go.  
There is moonlight and moss in the trees  
Down the Seven Bridges Road.  
  
Now I have loved you like a baby...  
Like some lonesome child,  
And I have loved you in a tame way,  
And I have loved you wild.  
  
Sometimes there's a part of me  
Has to turn from here and go...  
Running like a child from these warm stars  
Down the Seven Bridges Road.  
  
There are stars in the southern sky.  
And if ever you decide you should go,  
There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey  
Down the Seven Bridges Road.

"Open up your eyes  
Take the devil from your mind  
He's been holding on to you  
And you're so hard to find  
The wind outside is cold  
Restless feeling in my soul  
Tempting me to get away  
But there's no place a man can go  
God, will you lead me where I roam?  
Help me not to let my feelings show  
No, no you are the one, oh, how could you be  
So blind?  
The devil prays on runaways  
He's never far behind  
The many years I've tried  
Now have been revealed to me  
Closer is the love you'll find  
Waiting so patiently  
God, will you lead me where I roam?  
Help me not to let my feelings show.  
No, no  
Take the devil  
Take the devil  
From your mind

"It wasn't really sad the way they said goodbye  
Or maybe it just hurt so bad, she couldn't cry  
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away  
And she became the girl from yesterday  
  
He took a plane across the sea to some foreign land  
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand  
How someone who had been so close could be so far away  
And she became the girl from yesterday  
  
She doesn't know what's right, she doesn't know what's wrong  
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting so long  
And she doesn't count the teardrops that she's cried while he's away  
Because she knows deep in her heart that he'll be back someday  
  
The light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone  
Talking to a memory that's never coming home  
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say  
But she'll always be the girl from yesterday  
Yeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday

"When you're out there on your own  
Where your memories can find you  
Like a circle goes around  
You were lost until you found out  
What it all comes down to  
  
One by one  
The lonely feelings come  
Day by day, they slowly fade away  
  
Ooh, the look was in her eyes  
You never know what might be found there  
She was dancing right in time  
And the moves she made so fine  
Like the music that surrounds her  
  
Should I stay or go?  
I really want to know  
Would I loose or win  
If I try and love again?  
Oh oh oh gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh I'm gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh gonna try and love  
  
Right or wrong, what's done is done  
It's only moments that you borrow  
But the thoughts will linger on  
Of the lady and her song  
When the sun comes up tomorrow  
  
Well, it might take years  
To see through all these tears  
Don't let go  
When you find it you will know  
  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Sometimes lose, sometimes win,  
Sometimes you need a friend

And there's music on my mind  
Lookin' for my destination and  
My home is far behind  
'cause it's a long road ahead  
And you can make it in the end  
And I'm gonna make it with my friends  
And I'm tryin'  
It took me sometime to see it  
Now I'm looking through this world  
And it's gonna take some time before  
I get back, help me girl  
'cause you can make it if you try  
You gotta lay it on the line  
And everything will be fine if you try  
Sittin' smokin' just a thinkin'  
Is an easy thing to do  
We gotta keep on trying for  
The feelin' to come through  
And it's a lonely way to live  
You gotta take it, you gotta live  
If you mistake it, just try again  
And I'm trying, yeah!  
Got to keep on trying  
Ah, we got to keep on trying  
Yeah I'm trying.... etc..
