"She gets the sun in the daytime  
Perfume in the dusk  
And she comes out in the night time  
With the honeysuckle musk  
Because she smells just like a rose  
And she tastes just like a peach  
She got me walking where the wildlife goes  
I'd do anything to reach her  
  
And she was made in heaven  
Heaven's in the world  
Is this just expresso love  
You know I'm crazy for the girl  
  
She call me just to talk  
She's my lover, she's a friend of mine  
She says hey mister you wanna take a walk  
In the wild west end sometime  
And I get trouble with my breathing  
She says boys don't know anything  
But I know what I want  
I want everything  
  
Well I feel so good 'cause I feel so good  
And I feel so good 'cause it feels so right  
I was made to go with my girl  
Like a saxophone was made to go with the night  
  
And she can raise one eyebrow  
Put her hand on my hip  
And I close one eye now  
Sweat on her tip  
And I surrender to the fever  
She love me so tender I got to believe her  
Love? expresso love's alright  
  
I don't want no sugar in it  
Thank you very much  
All wired up on it all fired up on it  
Expresso touch  
Hey maestro expresso  
It's just another one just like the other one  
Hey maestro expresso  
Is this another one just like the other one

"I'm not alone sitting right there  
How come I get the feeling you'd vanish into the air  
I love you more than anybody else, babe  
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch.  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much  
If I picked you up, oh you'd slip right away  
If I locked you up, you'd find a way to make me pay.  
You're gonna hurt me more than anybody else babe  
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much.  
  
Guess I'm gonna get you what you want  
'Cause I'm so into you  
You don't even give an inch to me baby  
Though I've been giving you a mile or two  
  
I'm not alone sitting right there  
How come I get the feeling you'd vanish into the air  
I love you more than anybody else, babe  
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch.  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much  
If I picked you up, oh you'd slip right away  
If I locked you up, you'd find a way to make me pay.  
You're gonna hurt me more than anybody else babe  
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much.  
  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much (repeat)

"Now warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control  
Somebody threw a spanner and they threw it in a hole  
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town  
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls are closing down  
There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell  
There's leaking in the washroom there's a stinking personnel  
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze  
'Goodness me could this be Industrial Disease?  
  
The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post  
They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most  
The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas  
And everyone's concerned about Industrial Disease  
There's panic on the switchboard tongues are in knots  
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots  
Some blame the management some the employees  
Everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease  
  
The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks  
Innocence is injured experience just talks  
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees  
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'  
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse  
Philosophy is useless, theology is worse  
History boils over there's an economics freeze  
  
Sociologists invent words that mean 'Industrial Disease'  
Doctor Parkinson declared 'I'm not surprised to see you here  
You've got smokers cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer  
I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis ease  
But worst of all young man you've got Industrial Disease'  
  
He wrote me a prescription he said 'you are depressed  
But I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest  
Come back and see me later - next patient please  
Send in another victim of Industrial Disease'  
I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck  
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks  
Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong  
There's a protest singer singing a protest song - he says  
They want to have a war to keep their factories  
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees  
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese  
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease  
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind  
They want to sap your energy, incarcerate your mind  
They give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three  
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'  
Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon  
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'  
The other one's out on hunger strike he's dying by degrees  
How come Jesus gets Industrial Disease?

"With all the clarity of dream  
The sky so blue, the grass so green  
The rank and file and the navy blue  
The deep and strong, the straight and true  
  
The blue line they got the given sign  
The belts and boots march forward in time  
The wood and leather the club and shield  
Swept like a wave across the battlefield  
  
Now with all the clarity of dream  
The blood so red, the grass so green  
The gleam of spur on chestnut flank  
The cavalry did burst upon the ranks  
  
Oh the iron will and iron hand  
In England's green and pleasant land  
No music for the shameful scene  
That night they said it had even shocked the queen  
  
Well alas we've seen it all before  
Knights in armor, days of yore  
The same old feasance and the same old crimes  
We haven't changed since ancient times

"Red sun go down way over dirty town  
Starlings are sweeping around crazy shoals  
A girl is there high heeling across the square  
Wind blows around in her hair and the flaqs upon the poles  
Waiting in the crowd to cross at the light  
She looks around to find a face she can like  
  
Church bell clinging on trying to get a crowd for Evensong  
Nobody cares to depend to depend upon the chime it plays  
They're all in the station praying for trains  
Congregation late again  
It's getting darker all the time these flagpole days  
Drunk old soldier he gives her a fright  
He's crazy lion howling for a fight  
  
Strap hanging gunshot sound  
Doors slamming on the overground  
Starlings are tough but the lions are made of stone  
Her evening paper is horror torn  
But there's hope later for Capricorns  
Her lucky stars give her just enough to get her home  
Then she's reading about a swing to the right  
But she's thinking about a stranger in the night  
I'm thinking about the lions tonight  
What happened to the lions

"
"There's gotta be a record of you someplace  
You gotta be on somebody's books  
The lowdown, a picture of your face  
Your injured looks  
The sacred and profane  
The pleasure and the pain  
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street  
  
A ladykiller, regulation tattoo  
Silver spurs on his heels  
Says, what can I tell you, as I'm standing next to you  
She threw herself under my wheels  
Oh it's a dangerous road  
And a hazardous load  
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street  
  
A three-chord symphony crashes into space  
The moon is hanging upside down  
I don't know why it is I'm still on the case  
It's a ravenous town  
And you still refuse to be traced  
Seems to me such a waste  
And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

"
"I'm a soldier of freedom in the army of man  
We are the chosen, we're the partisan  
The cause it is noble and the cause it is just  
We are ready to pay with our lives if we must  
  
Gonna ride across the river deep and wide  
Ride across the river to the other side  
  
I'm a soldier of fortune, I'm a dog of war  
And we don't give a damn who the killing is for  
It's the same old story with a different name  
Death or glory, it's the killing game  
  
Gonna ride across the river deep and wide  
Ride across the river to the other side  
  
Nothing gonna stop them as the day follows the night  
Right becomes wrong, the left becomes the right  
And they sing as they march with their flags unfurled  
Today in the mountains, tomorrow the world  
  
Gonna ride across the river deep and wide  
Ride across the river to the other side

"I seen a girl on a one way corridor  
Stealing down a wrong way street  
For all the world like an urban toreador  
She had wheels on on her feet  
Well the cars do the usual dances  
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl  
But the roller girl she's taking chances  
They just love to see her take them all  
  
No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd  
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud  
  
Hallelujah here she comes queen roller ball  
Enchante what can I say don't care at all  
You know she used to have to wait around  
She used to be the lonely one  
But now that she can skate around town  
She's the only one  
  
No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd  
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud  
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station  
And a rock and roll dream  
She's making movies on location  
She don't know what it means  
But the music make her want to be the story  
And the story was whatever was the song what it was  
Roller girl don't worry  
DJ play the movies all night long  
  
She tortures taxi drivers just for fun  
She like to read their lips  
Says toro toro taxi see ya tomorrow my son  
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip  
She got her own world in the city  
You can't intrude on her  
She got her own world in the city  
'Cause the city's been so rude to her  
  
No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd  
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud  
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station  
And a rock and roll dream  
She's making movies on location  
She don't know what it means  
But the music make her want to be the story  
And the story was whatever was the song what it was  
Roller girl don't worry  
DJ play the movies all night long  
  
Come slipping and sliding  
Life's roller ball  
Slipping and a sliding  
Skate away that's all  
Shala shalay hey hey skate away  
She's going singing shala shalay hey hey  
Skate away

"Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose  
Sing about the six blade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo  
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam  
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am  
  
In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light  
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night  
I put my hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll  
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk  
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this  
It's just a cakewalk twisting baby step right up and say  
Hey mister give me two give me two 'cause any two can play  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig  
Money for muscle another girl I dig  
Another hustle just to make it big  
And rock away rock away  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids  
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids  
  
She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this  
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss  
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away  
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
stay  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades  
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades  
In any shooting gallery where promises are made  
To rock away rock away from Cullercoats and Whitley bay out to rock away  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids  
Girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids

"Baby, I see this world has made you sad  
Some people can be bad  
The things they do the things they say  
  
But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears  
I'll chase away those restless fears  
That turn your blue skies into gray  
  
Why worry  
There should be laughter after pain  
There should be sunshine after rain  
These things have always been the same  
So why worry now  
Why worry now  
  
Baby, when I get down I turn to you  
And you make sense of what I do  
And all the isn't hard is the same  
  
But baby, just when this world seems mean and cold  
Our love comes shinning red and gold  
And all the rest is by the way  
  
Why worry  
There should be laughter after pain  
There should be sunshine after rain  
These things have always been the same  
So why worry now  
Why worry now

"It's late in the evening  
She wonders what clothes to wear  
She puts on her make up  
And brushes her long blonde hair.  
And then she asked me  
Do I look alright?  
I said yes, you look wonderful tonight  
  
We go to a party  
And everyone turns to see  
This beautiful woman walking around with me  
And then she asked me  
Do you feel alright?  
I said yes, I don't feel good  
I feel wonderful because I see  
No love light in your eyes  
And the wonder of it all  
Is that you just don't realize  
How much I love you.  
  
It's time to go home now  
And I got a big headache  
So i give her the car keys  
She helps me to bed  
And then I told her  
As I turned out the lights  
I say my darling  
You were wonderful tonight  
Oh my darling,  
You were wonderful tonight

"Will you and your friend come around  
Are you and your friend gonna get on down  
Will you and your friend come around  
Or are you and your friend gonna let me down  
  
If you talk to one another  
I'm a hungry man  
Let me know one way or the other  
So I can make my plans  
  
Will you and your friend come around  
Or are you and your friend gonna get on down  
Will you and your friend come around  
Or are you and your friend gonna get on down  
  
I relive the situation  
Still see it in my mind  
You got my imagination  
Working overtime

"All the late night bargains have been struck  
Between the satin beans and their bells  
Prehistoric garbage trucks  
Got the city to themselves  
Echoes and the roars dinosaurs  
They're all doing the monster mash  
And most of the taxis and the whores  
Are only taking calls for cash  
  
I don't know how it happened  
It all took place so quick  
But all I can do is hand it to you  
And your latest trick  
  
My door was standing open  
Security was laid back and lax  
But it was only my heart got broken  
You must have had a pass key made out of wax  
You played robbery with insolence  
And I played the blues in twelve bars on Lover's Lane  
And you never did have the intelligence to use  
The twelve keys hanging off my chain  
  
I don't know how it happened  
It all took place so quick  
But all I can do is hand it to you  
And your latest trick  
  
Now it's past last call far alcohol  
Past recall has been here and gone  
The landlord finally paid us all  
The satin jazzmen have put away their horns  
And we're standing outside of these wonderlands  
Looking so bereaved and so bereft  
Like a bowery bum when he finally understands  
The bottle's empty and there's nothing left  
  
I don't know how it happened  
It all took place so quick  
But all I can do is hand it to you  
And your latest trick
