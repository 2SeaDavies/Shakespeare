I'm moving away from your door  
Lord, I've packed up my clothes  
Said, I'm moving away from your door  
I've been your fool for so long  
Babe, I won't play that fool no more  
I gave you all my money  
I work as hard as I can  
I came home early one morning  
I found you with another man  
Babe, I've packed up my clothes  
I'm moving away from your door  
Said, I've been your fool for so long  
And Lord, I won't play that fool no more

So good-bye baby  
you don't even care  
Yes, I had a love so strong for you  
but you treat me so unfair  
Said, I've packed up my clothes  
I'm moving away from your door  
You know, I've been your fool for so long  
And babe, I won't play that fool no more

"One set of doors was the color of honey  
One set of doors was pink and grey  
Well I wonder which set is mine, said she  
As she walked down the long hallway  
  
Well I wonder which set of rooms are mine  
For in these rooms she would live and die  
  
Well it's better to have loved and lost  
(Ah but it's better not to lose)  
Than to never have loved at all  
Never have loved, never have loved at all  
Well it's better to have loved and lost  
(Ah but it's better not to lose)  
Than to always be alone  
Always be alone  
In your heart  
  
I thought that there was more involved  
Through all that time and all these  
months  
I stopped many times to question you  
Well I told you that it was the right  
thing to do  
  
Well it's better to have loved and lost  
(Ah but it's better not to lose)  
Than to never have loved at all  
Never have loved, never have loved at all  
Yes it's better to have loved and lost  
(Ah but it's better not to lose)  
Than to always be alone  
Always be alone  
In your heart  
  
But I knew that this was just for now  
And the time would take its toll upon  
us all  
Well it would break our hearts  
Tear it apart  
But no one understood  
The affairs of the heart  
  
Well it's better to have loved and lost  
Than to never have loved at all  
Never have loved, never have loved at all  
Well it'll break your heart, tear it apart  
But no one understands  
No one understands  
The affairs of the heart

"Well it's time to say goodnight  
And finally turn out the light  
How do I say in some simple way  
How much you have been on my mind  
But I have to let you go  
It's time to move on, don't you know  
But you can rely on a love that won't die  
For haven't I told you so  
So let's stop before it's too late  
And leave it all up to the fates  
Cause in spite of the heartaches  
And troubles in love  
I'd do it all over  
Do it all over again  
Each of us and everyone  
Carries a burden of love  
But as far as I go in my heart I know  
It's you I'll be thinking of  
So what is there left to say  
As I see us drifting away  
You can always depend on a love that won't end  
Won't you think of me, think of me that way  
So let's stop before it's too late  
And leave it all up to the fates  
Cause in spite of the heartaches  
And troubles in love  
I'd do it all over again  
Well it's it's time to move on to the rain  
And finally break the chain  
In spite of the heartaches  
And troubles in love  
I'd do it all over (do it all over)  
Do it all over again  
Stop before it's too late  
Cause in spite of the heartaches  
And troubles in love  
I'd do it all over (do it all over)  
I'd do it all over again

"Although the sun is shining  
High above  
There's one thing on my mind  
You my love  
  
I see a weeping willow  
In the park  
Like this there's sadness growing  
In my heart  
  
When we're together  
We will never part  
And if you leave me  
It'll break, it'll break my heart  
  
When we're together  
We will never part

Maybe I want, to be back in time  
I've got a sweet lot of memories, of another place  
And a heart full of longing, for another life

Angel, I want to see you  
Angel, I really want to see you  
Angel, I want to see you, right now  
  
Oh how I wish, I could see an angel  
Deliver me from, this dark despair  
I've got a sweet lot of plans that have come to nothing  
And a life that's in need, of a good repair  
Angel, I want to see you  
Angel, I really want to see you  
You know I want to see you  
  
Angel, I really want to see you, right now  
Under a sky, of gun metal grey  
No omens in sight for all around  
Just living alone, with a hope that someday  
I might see and angel arise, to take me down  
Angel, I want to see you  
Angel, lord I want to see you

Can't believe that you're back again

Gone away too far

To get back where you are

With the light shining in your eyes

Can't sleep  
I lay here thinkin' 'bout a woman  
I used to love  
Can't sleep but no good to count sheep  
I'll just count the worries  
That I've got plenty of  
  
And how many times  
Must I be the fool  
Before I can make it  
Oh make it on home  
I've got to find a place to sing my words  
Is there nobody listening to my song?  
  
You talk about a life  
Been searching for the key  
But can't find an answer  
To comfort me  
I ask myself about love  
Can't even find the door  
To take me to a place  
I've never seen before  
  
But how many times  
Must I be the fool  
Before I can make it  
Oh make it on home

In everything you've done  
Even though you've stopped the sun from shining

And times have been so tough, that I can't tell you  
What can you say to accuse me  
When you know I'm not to blame  
You know you're gonna use me  
I guess I'll always feel the same  
Oh, when will we be together

I guess you've heard about the bermuda triangle  
There's something going on  
Nobody seems to know just what it is  
And the airforce won't let on  
It might be hole down in the ocean  
Yeah or a fog that won't let go  
It might be some crazy people talking  
Or somebody that we ought to know  
Down in bermuda, the pale blue sea  
Way down in the triangle, it's easy to believe  
Now here's one  
You see strange shapes in moonlight  
And shadows in the night  
They said that wingtip seemed to brush their faces  
And strangers stole their sight  
Way down in the triangle  
Where the sea was smooth as glass  
Giving you one answer to a question  
That you never thought you'd ask  
Ah down in bermuda, in the pale blue sea  
Way down in bermuda, yeah it's easy to believe  
Down in the triangle, it's easy to believe  
They came from galveston  
They came from new orleans  
And then from bloomington, and delaware  
The used st. petersburg, they came from tampa  
And then from mexico, it doesn't matter where  
They all completely share,  
All of those ships and planes,  
A great big mystery that cannot be explained,  
Down in bermuda, in the pale blue sea  
Your feeling safe in your harbour  
And everything seems certain  
Right next to palm beach and key biscane  
Behind a velvet curtain  
But then the moon goes grey with worry  
And the sea turns a pale white  
You better believe something strange is going on tonight  
Down in bermuda, ah, the pale blue sea  
Bermuda triangle, yeah, it's easy to believe  
Down in the triangle, it's easy to believe  
They came from galveston  
They came from new orleans  
And then from bloomington, and delaware

Don't let waters of caution remove you  
Don't let the fire of saints compel you  
Don't let the lack of their spirit blind your life  
Cause soon it's all over, you're gonna come through alive  
Well I've been all over the world five times or more  
And I've seen the future burn blue before my eyes  
And all through the dust and the green magnesium fire  
Don't let the violence blind you, you're gonna come through alive  
And the roses that are offing  
They are real as evening wind  
They are washed by love and suffering  
Cause my love has colored them  
Colored them  
Oooooh oooohh-nothing but roses  
Don't dam the river that's running through you  
Stop saving up for time that may never become  
I've seen the future come true in twenty days  
But don't let is scare you, stop thinking about yesterday  
I've had my share of blue revelations  
And I know that time is a region to be passed  
So all through the dust and green magnesium fire  
I can rest easy now, and watch the carnival rolling by  
Cause a rose that will be growing  
In the place where I have hidden  
It is washed by love and suffering  
That my love has colored in  
Look where the roses grow

Look where the rooooooooses

Lonesome tears you're gonna cry for me.

You'd better start baby, and leave.  
  
Think it over before you leave,  
I got the love, that kind you need.  
  
And little baby,  
You'd better start baby and leave.  
  
I'll rave on with the things you say,  
You say you're gonna leave but that'll be the day.  
  
Maybe baby, you don't know,  
I left Peggy Sue, a long time ago.  
  
She's the girl on my mind,  
Everyday through all the time.

Standin' in the shadows  
The man I used to be  
I wanna go back  
(can't go back, can't go back)  
Melodies awaken  
Sorrows from their sleep  
I wanna go back  
(can't go back, can't go back)  
She was just a dream maker,  
Dreamer of sighs  
Shadow on the one who used to cry  
A face as soft as a tear in a clown's eye  
I wanna go back  
(can't go back, can't go back)

"Now it's the same as before  
And I'm alone again  
  
With no sorrow for myself  
And I'm blaming no one else  
  
And closing my eyes  
And seeing you standing there  
  
Now it's the same as before  
You've touched me with your love  
  
And though you're in my heart  
We're still a world apart  
As now I'm back to the time  
Where I would search for a dream  
But no use to try anymore as before  
Someday I'll die, and maybe then I'll be with you  
  
So I'm closing my eyes  
To hear the people laugh  
  
For they're all aglow  
Not knowing where to go  
  
But is it asking too much  
When the question is what to do  
With the life I'll have  
It seems I know nothing now  
Except my love for you  
And the strength in my hands  
To go on feeding your smile

I knew she wasn't nowhere around  
She left me early that morning, with a suitcase in her hand  
She left me early that morning, yes, with a suitcase in her hand  
And she took off on a train this mornin'  
And she was meetin' some other man, yes  
She used to treat me real good and I wonder why I  
Didn't treat her right  
Yes, ah, you know I wonder why I didn't treat her right

I said I was going before it got away  
She's been here a while  
Living in the guest room  
I guess she goes in style  
I said I was going before it got away  
But I just can't let her go  
Can you feel the fever?  
  
Now I lay me down to sleep in this enemy bed  
Tomorrow morning I will wake up  
Hurting from the things we've said  
One thing leads to another  
But I guess you know about that  
Can you feel the fever?

Drove me through the mountains  
Through the crystal like and clear water fountain  
Drove me like a magnet

How the faces of love have changed turning the pages  
And I have changed, oh, but you, you remain ageless

Makes your day to day life easy  
Emerald eyes is a mystery

Only an honest word, maybe a sky report  
Could be a weather bird it was so close to me

Well, I know you don't agree  
  
You can't love him  
You can't have him  
I do have him, most of the time  
Anywhere we can, baby  
Anytime we can  
Get away  
  
We see no change in sight  
Watching her decline  
She gets on a midnight plane  
She's done it a thousand times  
  
When love starts out in the darkness  
It doesn't do well in the light  
Affairs of the heart  
That start out in the dark  
Usually stay with the night  
  
When nobody sees them  
At least, not together  
She rarely goes out  
She spends every day  
Waiting for the day  
  
When everybody finds out  
  
Don't you know, don't you know  
  
You can't love him  
You can't have him  
I do have him, most of the time  
Anywhere we can  
Anytime we can  
Get away, get away

"Don't keep me hanging on a string  
Tell me what I feel is no big thing  
Don't turn away I'm listening  
Over and over again  
  
Don't give me visions to explain  
There are no doubts I feel the strain  
Of all my senses yearning  
Over and over again  
  
Every day I see you  
Every day I need you  
Every way I breathe you  
On and on and on and on again  
Again  
  
It's not important to wonder why  
What is just is  
No more to imply  
This simple thought repeating  
Over and over again  
  
Everyday I see you  
Everyday I need you  
Every way I breathe you  
On and on and on and on again  
  
Imagine all the ways to cope  
I close my eyes, that gives me hope  
It cures the silence  
  
Everyday I see you  
Everyday I need you  
Every way I breathe you  
On and on and on and on  
  
Everyday I see you  
I see you  
Everyday I need you  
I need you  
Every way I breathe you  
On and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on again  
Again

And to keep him from the fire  
I choose to be quietly discreet  
But that is his desire  
I touch with gossamer wings  
To be quiet around you  
There is so much going on  
You could easily  
Wake up with a stranger  
  
It's not something that you plan  
One night in a world of pain  
You finally understand  
Not all the king's horses  
Not all the king's men  
Could put it back together  
  
You said you wouldn't do this for very long  
It is so defining  
Well it bounces off the wall  
And you  
When the miracle is happening  
High priestess  
She's the keeper of the peace  
And there's Twice as much... intensify  
What people will do  
To get... this... high...  
  
It's not something that you plan  
One night in a world of pain  
You finally understand  
Not all the king's horses  
Not all the king's men  
Could put it back together  
  
And now alone in my room  
As it all begins again  
Was I so wrong  
Why am I always so intense  
In this same place I sit  
The same place as before  
I came all the way here  
Just to watch you walk out that door  
  
I didn't ask when you shook your head  
I always accepted what you said as the truth  
And the truth only  
Well, it's not enough that you depend on me  
It's not enough that you say you love me  
It's not enough to just save face  
  
Because sometimes you just fall from grace  
Sometimes you just fall from grace  
  
Maybe I am calmer now  
Maybe things are fine  
Maybe I made the whole thing up  
Maybe it isn't a lie  
Maybe the reason I say these things  
Is to bring you back alive  
Maybe I've fought this long and this hard  
Just to make sure you survive  
Just to make sure you survive

Talking of journeys that happen in vain

Take your silver spoon  
Dig your grave

Wake up in the morning  
See your sunrise loves to go down  
Lousy lovers pick their prey  
But they never cry out loud  
Cry out  
  
Did she make you cry  
Make you break down  
Shatter your illusions of love  
And is it over now do you know how  
Pick up the pieces and go home.  
  
Rock on ancient queen  
Follow those who pale  
In your shadow  
  
Rulers make bad lovers  
You better put your kingdom up for sale  
Up for sale  
  
Well did she make you cry  
Make you break down  
Shatter your illusions of love  
And is it over now, do you know how  
Pickup the pieces and go home.

Are starting to wear me down  
And when I need you  
You just can't be found  
  
Loud days, endless nights  
Are starting to make me crazy  
And now youre gone  
Theres nothing left for me  
  
(hollywood)  
I don't care for sunny weather  
(aint that good)  
I like the change of seasons better  
(knock on wood)  
I love the feel of rain upon my face  
(for hollywood)  
(hollywood)  
No and I don't care if the snow comes down  
(aint that good)  
Kick the falling leaves around  
(knock on wood)  
Got to move to some other kind of town  
(for hollywood)  
  
Wonderful to know you  
Great to know you cared  
As I look back  
At the crazy things weve shared  
  
I was dazzled by the moonlight  
Blinded by neon nights  
And as I look back  
It never could be right

I don't care for sunny weather

Well I was dazzled by the moonlight  
Blinded by neon nights  
And now I see  
It never could be right

"I want to sit at home in my rockin' chair  
I don't want to travel the world  
As far as I'm concerned I've had my share  
But times more precious than gold  
I don't wanna see another airplane seat  
Or another hotel room  
The home life to me seems really neat  
I just wanna unpack for good  
  
Buy me a ticket homeward bound (homeward bound)  
Buy me a ticket homeward bound (oh homeward bound  
  
Well it all seems the same when you've done it before  
There's no difference in the style  
There's no end insight or my own front door  
I'll be a stay at home for awhile  
So I'll have another drink and a cigarette  
Just to console myself some how  
It's not too bad if you can forget  
I've just got to find a way somehow  
  
Buy me a ticket homeward bound (homeward bound)  
Buy me a ticket homeward bound (oh homeward bound  
  
Buy me a ticket homeward bound (homeward bound)

"Oh baby, you know I may be a fool  
I'm wastin' my time by goin' to school  
The way you got me holdin' your door  
  
I can't do my homework anymore  
I can't do my homework anymore  
Oh baby, I said you got me so blind  
I'm walkin' 'round in circles, I could loose my mind  
  
The way you got me holdin' your door  
I can't do my homework anymore  
Now baby your as sweet as you can be  
Everything you do keep on sending me  
Just the kiss of your lips or the touch of your hand  
  
Everything you do is really grand  
Oh baby, oh, now what can I do  
I'm walkin' round in circles in love with you  
The way you got me holdin' your door  
  
I can't do my homework anymore  
Now baby your as sweet as you can be  
Everything you do keep on sending me

Oh baby, oh, now what can I do

"Now, my baby's a country girl,  
And she just can't help herself.  
Yes, my baby's a country girl,  
And she just can't help herself.  
And every time I tell her I'm gonna leave her,  
She say I don't want nobody else.  
  
I sat around and cried,  
'til the tears run down my cheek.  
Yes, I sat around at night and cried,  
'til the tears run down my cheek.  
I said Baby, don't you worry,  
I got you plenty milk and meat.  
  
One day baby, you gonna think your dad's gone.  
Oh, baby. Don't every think your daddy's gone.  
Well, you know he right there with you,  
Standing in blood and all.  
  
Well, I buys her everything she need,  
She don't even have to go nowhere.  
My baby gets everything she needs,  
She don't even have to go nowhere.  
Now, God aughta bless me, aughta bless me  
I even bought that girl some help.  
  
Weren't for lipstick and powder,  
No I don't know what my baby would do.  
Weren't for lipstick and powder,  
I don't know what in the world that girl would do.  
But I love that woman in this story I'm tellin' you.  
  
Baby, honey, do you feel alright?  
Hey, baby, I wanna know do you feel alright?  
I wanna love you baby,  
If you tell me daddy you knew I ain't tired tonight.

"It's the same kind of story  
That seems to come down from long ago  
Two friends having coffee together  
When something flies by their window  
It might be out on that lawn  
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field  
Because there's no explaining what your imagination  
Can make you see and feel  
  
Seems like a dream  
They got me hypnotized  
  
Now it's not a meaningless question  
To ask if they've been and gone  
I remember a talk about north  
Carolina and a strange, strange pond  
You see the sides were like glass  
In the thick of a forest without a road  
And if any man's hand ever made that land  
Then I think it would've showed  
  
Seems like a dream  
They got me hypnotized  
  
They say there's a place down in mexico  
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills  
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine  
And he never will  
Now you know it's a meaningless question  
To ask if those stories are right  
'Cause what matters most is the feeling  
You get when you're hypnotized  
  
Seems like a dream  
They got me hypnotized

"I just talked to my baby - on the telephone  
She said, stop what your doing and - come on home  
I can't hold out, I can't hold out to long  
I get a real good feeling - talking to you on the phone  
  
She said, daddy you know I love you your my hearts desire, um  
Stay right here with you till the day I die  
I can't hold out, I can't hold out to long  
I get a real good feeling - talking to you on the phone  
Oh yeah  
  
She daddy you can run, walk or fly  
Stay right here with you 'til the day I die  
I can't hold out, I can't hold out to long  
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone  
  
Whoa yeah, talk a to me baby  
Talk a to me baby  
Talk to me baby

I get a real good feeling - talking to you on the phone

"Oh my mind is made up about you  
Now and always  
Though the seasons come and they go  
Nothing will ever change  
Well I took a little chance  
And I laid my heart down  
I thought you'd be the one  
Who would always stick around  
I took a little time  
Though I knew it would be  
That we had a date with destiny  
Well out of the darkness  
And out of the long black night  
You have given me heart, yes  
And you showed me the light  
And I do, I do  
I love you for what you are  
Well this heart of mine  
I know it so well  
There are so many strange stories  
That I could tell  
Many is a time  
I went out on a limb  
You reached out for me baby  
And you brought me back again  
A lot of stormy nights  
I've seen many a full moon, but darling  
This is love in the afternoon  
Well out of the darkness  
And out of the long black night  
You have given me heart, yes  
And you showed me the light  
And I do, I do  
I love you for what you are  
So out of the darkness  
And out of the long black night  
You have given me heart, yes  
And you showed me the light  
And I do, I do  
I love you for what you are  
Yes I love you for what you are  
I love you for what you are  
I do love you for what you are  
Yes I do love you for what you are...

"Baby I've been your shadow  
I'm on your heels both night and day  
Baby I'm getting warmer  
I'm getting closer, inches away  
I've been watching every move you make  
And I've got feelings overdue  
  
I got it in for you  
(I got it in for you)  
I got it in for you  
(I got it in for you)  
  
I've been runnin' under cover  
In the darkness of the night  
So if you're looking over your shoulder  
You will see me out of sight  
Now I'm moving into your light  
I think it's high time you knew  
  
(I got it in for you)  
I'm not gonna give up  
(I got it in for you)  
Don't want to do without  
(I got it in for you)  
I'll win you over  
(I got it in for you)  
Over and over  
I got it in for you  
(I got it in for you)  
I got it in for you  
(I got it in for you)  
  
Baby don't you worry  
You won't be lonely anymore  
Baby I've been planning  
All the romance you're looking for  
And it's right outside your door  
And tonight I'm comin' through  
  
I got it in for you  
(I got it in for you)  
I got it in for you  
(I got it in for you)

"Written by lindsey buckingham.  
  
Her lips were waitin'  
Her eyes looked sad  
The dreams of a lifetime  
A year gone bad  
The dreams of a lifetime  
Told me wrong  
Everything is all right  
And now it's gone  
Don't blame me  
Please be strong I know I'm not wrong  
Here comes the nightime  
Lookin' for a little more  
Waitin' on the right time  
Somebody outside the door  
Don't blame me  
Please be strong I know I'm not wrong.

"My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself  
My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself  
I loved another woman - I lost my best gal  
  
She was a real good woman - she didn't me no harm  
She was a real good woman - she wouldn't do me no harm  
But I loved another woman - now she's up and she's gone  
  
Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong  
Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong  
I loved another woman - now, I won't do that no more

"When I think about you  
I think about how much I miss you  
When you're not around  
  
When I think about you  
I think about how much I can't wait  
To hear the sound of your laughter  
Time and distance never matter  
  
Well I miss you now  
I have so many questions  
About love and about pain  
About strained relationships  
About fame  
As only he could explain it to me  
  
Seems like yesterday  
I think about how much I  
Wish that you were here with me now  
The invisible girl  
That was my name  
She walks in and walks out  
And I'm sorry now  
I'm sorry now  
  
Well I miss you now  
I have so many questions  
About love and about pain  
About strained relationships  
About fame  
As only he could explain it to me  
  
Tell me again  
  
Paris to Rome  
London to Paris  
Always goodbye  
I nearly couldn't bear it  
Her heart settles down  
She's back on that staircase  
On the way up to her place  
  
I miss you now  
I have so many questions  
About love and about pain  
About strained relationships  
About fame

"Need someone's hand to lead me through the night  
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight  
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end  
  
Because I need your love so bad  
I need some lips to feel next to mine  
Need someone to stand up, to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'  
And when the lights are low, and it's time to go  
  
That's when I need your love so bad  
So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me  
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman, so it can be read to me  
  
Tell me that you love me, and stop drivin' me mad  
Whoa, because I, I need your love so bad  
Need a soft voice, just to talk to me at night  
Don't want you to worry, baby  
  
I know we can make everything alright  
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me  
'Cause I need, your love so bad  
Baby, I need, I need, woman, I need your love so bad

"It's hard  
When a love goes wrong  
Picking up the pieces to go on  
Our dreams  
Are scattered in the wind  
I won't let it take me under  
Even though you tried...and...  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
Why people lie, and break a heart in two  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
It's strange  
Strange the way I feel  
Time is all I need to make me heal  
You're gone  
And now I'm all alone (now you're all alone)  
I'll reclaim the thunder  
Dry the tears I've cried...still...  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
Why people lie, and break a heart in two  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
Now I'm turning my back on confusion  
I won't live in a world of illusion  
Well the river stopped running through me  
You didn't see what you did to me  
I've got to try to find, some kind of peace of mind  
You're just a mystery to me  
I'll reclaim the thunder  
Dry the tears I've cried...still...  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
Why people lie, and break a heart in two  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do

"Illume says the candle that I burn  
A reflection in the window  
All the way to Point Dume  
Illume, like it dances  
I am a cliff dweller  
From the old school  
  
I like the coastal cities  
I like the lights  
I like the way the ocean blends  
Into the city at night  
It's like living on a working river  
The coastline is glittering  
Like a diamond snake  
In a black sky  
  
I'm alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What we've been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
I will not take you for granted  
I wouldn't trade you for jade  
Or for diamonds  
Not for one minute  
Not for anything  
I need you to be there  
Just remember when I am haunted  
That I was just so scared  
  
I'm alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What we've been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
What I saw on this journey  
I saw history go down  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
It's just like a river  
Ooh, it's never ending  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
  
Because it's just like a river  
It's never ending  
It's just like a river  
It's never ending  
  
I'm alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What we've been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
What I saw on this journey  
I saw history go down  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
It's just like a river  
Ooh, it's never ending  
I cannot pretend

Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What we've been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
What I saw on this journey  
Is what legends are made of  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
It's just like a river  
Ooh, it's never ending  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
  
Because it's just like a river  
It's never ending  
It falls away  
Like a river  
It's never ending

"I been alone  
All the years  
So many ways to count the tears  
I never change  
I never will  
I'm so afraid the way I feel  
  
Days when the rain and the sun are gone  
Black as night  
Agony's torn at my heart too long  
So afraid  
Slip and I fall and I die.  
  
I been alone  
Always down  
No one cared to stay around  
I never change  
I never will

Black as night  
Agony's torn at my heart too long

You know she left me this mornin'  
And I don't know where she gone  
  
She said she wasn't gonna leave me  
She said she always gonna stay by my side  
She said she wasn't gonna leave me  
She said she always gonna stay by my side  
This time she mistreated me  
And I don't know how many times she lied  
  
Well I love my baby  
And I'll tell the world I do  
I love my baby  
I'll tell the world I do  
But now I've lost my baby  
I don't know what in the world I'm gonna do-yeah

"Moonshine time  
Thoughts of you  
Spinning round  
As thoughts do  
  
I just wondered if  
Your eyes still shine  
As they did  
When you were mine  
  
I can see  
In a dream  
Thoughts so clear  
And jewels that gleam  
  
Would your eyes  
Still sparkle then  
If we were, once again  
  
Jewel eyed Judy please come home  
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone  
Jewel eyed Judy please come home  
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone  
  
Lovely Judy  
Can you see  
Where it is  
You're meant to be  
  
Where you lay  
Your head tonight  
May the stars  
Find your light  
  
So am I  
Sitting here  
Moonlight glistens  
On my tears  
  
Is this all  
That we could find  
Chains of memories  
Left behind  
  
Jewel eyed Judy please come home  
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone  
Jewel eyed Judy please come home  
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone

You've got a sweet, sweet way  
You know you'll always be the only one  
And if you'll let me say  
You'll never be a lonely one  
Well you've just got something  
Makes a girl start feeling crazy  
And I'll do anything if you'll let me be your baby  
Even when everybody tells me  
I'm just being a fool  
Something inside says I've got to have you  
And I can't play by the rules  
Ooh baby baby tell me there's a chance for me  
'cause I'm crazy about you and I know this is love for me  
Well you just got something  
Makes a girl start feeling crazy  
And I'll do anything if you'll let me be your baby

For a little peace in any season  
I'd give up anything but your love  
I don't want to trade, tryin' to be happy  
That's only playin' anyway  
But if I dream about it, it makes me wonder  
For every good thing, must you get bad  
But I won't worry, and if I'm living on borrowed time  
I'm gonna keep on the way I'm going  
For every crime, there's retribution  
And every vally has a mountainside  
No, I don't like to trade just to be happy  
That kind of deal won't turn out right  
See it ain't good to stare inside yourself too long  
For every true thing theree's one more lie  
But I won't worry 'cause if I'm living on borrowed time  
I'll just try to keep on the way I'm going

"I took my love, I took it down  
Climbed a mountain and I turned around  
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills  
'Til the landslide brought it down  
Oh, mirror in the sky  
What is love?  
Can the child within my heart rise above?  
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?  
Can I handle the seasons of my life?  
?  
  
Well, I've been afraid of changin'  
'Cause I've built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Even children get older  
And I'm getting older too  
And I'm getting older too  
Oh, take my love, take it down  
Climb a mountain and turn around  
  
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well the landslide will bring it down  
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well the landslide will bring it down  
The landslide will bring it down

And the walls all close in as the fancy takes flight  
Can't stand to be loved,  
But she loves to be seen  
She slips down headlong into the night  
  
Miranda is taking the stars down  
A little something to call her own  
But the lion still rules Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
  
And then all at once the sun starts to rise  
She sees her father holding her down  
All the daylight is poison to her eyes  
She slips down the shade and lets herself drown  
  
Miranda is taking the stars down  
A little something to call her own  
But the lion still rules Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
  
The lights shine down the marina  
All across her safety zone  
But loneliness follows Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
Miranda is always alone  
Miranda is always alone

Seeing it very plain  
We've got to start again  
  
Everthing's going around in my head  
The futures new and the past is dead  
Pull out the stops, turn on the light  
Cause away from the darkness everything seems bright

"You're my little saviour  
You're the one I sleep with at night  
You take me in and promise me I'll be alright  
You're my little angel down from the heaven above  
I can't ask for much anymore,  
But you still smile and give me your love  
So if you fall asleep tomorrow,  
Then I know we can make it through this night  
But if you fall asleep as I hold you tight,  
You'll have moved on,  
Your love will be gone  
  
You're my little saviour,  
Hold me close and stare up into the stars  
Let me know if you think that there's someone up there  
Who still believes in us  
After I've lost all their trust,  
Just need someone to believe us  
So please just fall asleep tomorrow,  
'Cause sugar I know we can make it through the night  
Cause if you fall asleep as I hold you tight  
You'll have moved on, your love will be gone  
You were my little saviour,  
I was supposed to hold you through the night  
But I guess I let you down inside...  
You're my little saviour

Ooh ooh oh

Go on, you know you're only one  
Set me free  
You take me up and turn around  
But let me in  
Take this shadow from my eyes  
And tell me everything  
Take the desert from my soul  
And lift me up from down below  
Let me take some pride in your creation  
Cause I have lived alone in castles that were lonely  
And I have cursed the dawn and wondered why I do  
Well I have wondered why I live  
Now I know you must forgive  
Let me stand inside your magic shadow  
The night is coming faster  
And you're feeling all unchained  
In the north there is a jungle  
Where rockets are aflame  
And I hope that in the desert  
There are ships and there is noise  
And above the greatest city  
There will shine a magic shadow  
And a voice  
It's taking long but I'm getting strong as I grow old  
Please believe me let the magic reach me and I will unfold  
I'll step aboard with you onday  
And see my dust just melt away  
And then I'll step inside your magic shadow  
Dreamers...  
Ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhh  
Magic shadows  
Ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhhh  
Have you seen, have you seen  
Have you seen, have you seen  
Have you seen, have you seen  
Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows  
Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows  
Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows

When the memories fade  
There will be words we've said  
We just can't take away  
I'm only saying  
That as time goes sailing on  
Nothing is forgotten baby  
Nothing is really gone  
I remember the nights in Estoril  
A kiss and oh the never ending thrill  
And I remember the coming storm  
Oh and you my love, how you kept me warm  
Well there will be times  
When we can't agree  
We can't help but see things  
A little differently

How can something so right  
Ever be wrong  
I remember the nights in Estoril  
A kiss and oh the never ending thrill  
And I remember the coming storm  
Oh and you my love, how you kept me warm  
Your hand reaching out to me  
Dark clouds gathering in their wake  
I've seen it all before  
But I've never felt it more  
This time there is no mistake  
Oh I remember

How many more time, you gonna treat me like you do  
You spend all my money, all my lovin' too

"When I see him, I feel him  
There's an intenseness  
In him, in his eyes  
He wants me to be with him  
He wants me with him now  
  
She just seems to be missing  
How could that happen anyhow  
  
So how can you say  
Well I don't know what love is  
You haven't and you have no time for it  
You feel completely indifferent  
You feel pushed up against the wall  
And then one day it just almost goes away  
You spend lots of time alone  
Sometimes you spend years  
And you just miss those arms that used to go around you  
  
Night after night  
No questions asked and  
Who cares, the cold wind of it all, every time  
Well it's hard to be civil and it's  
Real hard to be nice  
But you did it my love, every time  
  
So how can you say well I can't see you  
Not now, not tomorrow, not until it's right  
Not until  
None of us is pushed up against the wall  
I don't know, the cold wind doesn't get you anymore  
  
So today she says well I've changed my mind  
That's a woman's right they say  
Well I'm frightened and I'm lost and I  
Can't give you up, not now I need you now  
I'm broken hearted, broke down  
Like a little girl  
Well I need you now, well I'm broken hearted  
Well I broke down, like a little girl  
  
(I need you now, no questions asked)  
Well I broke down like a little girl  
(I need you now, no questions asked)  
I broke down like a little girl  
(Need you now, no questions asked)  
I broke down like a little girl  
Well like a little girl  
(Need you now, no questions asked)  
Like a little girl  
Like a little girl

Isn't just that we cause each other such pain  
Everywhere we go now, at home or at play  
It hurts my self esteem, it hurts my everything  
I am reeling... Oh, it hurts my feelings  
Sometimes it was heavenly (Sometimes it was heavenly)  
Sometimes it was too heavy (Sometimes it was too heavy)  
Sometimes it's just too much for me (Sometimes it's just too much for me)  
Well I want to run away (Oh, well I want to run away)  
  
Then there are the things, cast this doubt away  
Those things that made me stay for so long  
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now  
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now  
I didn't understand then, but I understand now  
  
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times  
And they both rushed by, like a thief in the night  
Taking no prisoners, just like the first time  
Adventures in paradise  
Just like the first time  
  
Then there are the things, cast this doubt away  
Those things that made me stay for so long  
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now  
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now  
I didn't understand then, but I understand now  
  
Then there are the things, cast this doubt away

But you sending me reeling  
With the very mention of your name  
  
I want you and I need you  
I don't know what else to say  
(Don't you) Don't you think it's time  
(Don't you) Don't you think it's time (Don't you)  
Don't you think it's time That you remember me  
  
Remember me...

"He had all the rivers, under his power  
He had all the mountains, under his command  
You know that he had all the cities, in his own two hands  
Yes and he had control of the four winds  
  
And of the hunger of starving man  
And now we're passing on the reins  
'Cause in my heart I can feel the change  
You know the lord of light is laughing  
  
'Cause things don't stay the same,  
Revelation, revelation  
He controlled the brimstone, and eternal fire  
Surrounds himself with downers, in the king of cold  
  
You know that he had all the princes kissing his diamond ring  
And I heard that he walled up, the door to summer  
And cut the heart out of mister spring  
And now we're passing on the reins  
  
And in your heart you can feel a change  
You know the lord of light is laughing  
'Cause things don't stay the same,  
Revelation, revelation  
  
Dream on, keep your eyes wide open...  
On a Sunday morning, with a voice that's cold  
The future gives a warning of the fire that burns below  
He puts his hands together, cause his faith is strong  
  
And that's what you've been needing  
Oh but it don't seem to last too long  
'Cause now we're passing on the reins  
And in your heart you can feel a change  
  
You know the lord of light is laughing  
'Cause things don't stay the same,  
Revelation, revelation

"The magic of a blackened night  
Can go so far, but not seem right  
  
Although my love, will drive away the sunshine  
The magic of, a blackened night  
And before you go show me  
All the words of love  
  
And the falling sands of time  
Blow my wind and drifted by  
To and fro the trees still bend  
Wondering what the host will send  
We will go right down to the sea  
Bathing in light we will be free to wander  
  
And the falling sands of time  
Blow my wind and drifted by  
To and fro the trees still bend  
Wondering what the host will send  
We will go right down to the sea

Don't know why I can't play

Save me a place

Don't know why I have to go  
Don't know why I can't stay  
Guess I want to be alone  
And I guess I need to be amazed  
Save me a place

I'll come running if you love me today.

"Something in you brought out something in me  
That I've never been since  
That part of me that was only for you  
That kind of romance  
Comes only once, that kind of love  
That kind of fever dance  
That you love because you've become someone else  
In an instant  
  
Say you will, say you will give me one more chance  
At least give me time to change your mind  
That always seems to heal the wounds  
If I can get you to dance  
  
Something in you put a hold on my heart  
It's hard to believe now  
Here is a place that will never be dark  
I remember that place  
That kind of touch, electricity of love  
That certain kind of grace  
That you love because you become someone else  
In an instant  
  
Say you will, say you will give me one more chance  
At least give me time to change your mind  
That always seems to heal the wounds  
If I can get you to dance  
  
Say you will, say you will give me one more chance  
(Say you will)  
At least give me time to change your mind

If I can get you to dance

"So long ago  
Certain place  
Certain time  
You touched my hand  
All the way  
All the way down to Emmiline  
But if our paths never cross  
Well you know I'm sorry but  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end  
I'll never live to match the beauty again  
The rainbow's end  
  
So it's hard to find  
Someone with that kind of intensity  
You touched my hand I played it cool  
And you reached out your hand for me  
But if our paths never cross  
Well you know I'm sorry but  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end  
I'll never live to match the beauty again  
The rainbow's end  
  
So long ago  
It's a certain time  
It's a certain place  
You touched my hand and you smiled  
All the way back you held out your hand  
If I hope and I pray  
Ooh it might work out someday  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end  
I'll never live to match the beauty again  
  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end

"She was a silver girl  
Lost in a high tech world  
She was a golden girl  
Immersed in a hard core world  
She would have preferred  
The last generation  
But that's all right  
She's on her way  
  
She had the Midas touch  
She was Lady Luck  
She's got a million bucks  
And she looks like it  
She's had a few hard times  
Sometimes it blows her mind  
Those papers she never signed  
Sometimes she remembers  
  
Sometimes she was just an actress  
But you'll never really know  
A shadow moves across her face  
You cannot see her soul  
Unless she lets you  
See her soul  
  
She was a girlie girl  
Caught in a man's world  
And as her world turns  
She feels so alone  
Still she's a danger girl  
Insane far beyond her years  
On some things she's very clear  
She's a wild adventurer  
  
Sometimes she was just an actress  
But you'll never really know  
A shadow moves across her face  
You cannot see her soul  
  
Sometimes she was just an actress

"She came in like a hurricane  
Wearing boots and diamond rings  
With a fox fur on her shoulder  
She set wondering  
And I could tell she was feeling abandoned  
Because she flashed a look across my way  
She said hop for a ride  
You'll never ask me but I'll tell you anyway  
  
She took me out on the blackboard jungle  
Put me straight in a hurricane  
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways  
If I could sing like Paul McCartney, or get funky like Etta James  
I'd never change, I'd never change, I'd never change silver heeled ways  
  
She came in and her flags were flying  
She was a sailboat of sweet perfume  
And I could see that her eyes were smiling  
From across the room  
Well I couldn't think of conversation  
I was busy looking at her furs  
She said hey, you'll never ask me  
So I guess I'll say the word  
  
She took me out on the blackboard jungle  
Put me straight in a hurricane  
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways  
If I could sing like Paul McCartney, and funky like Etta James  
I'd never change, I'd never change, No I'd never change silver heeled ways  
  
(silver, silver heels) that's what I mean  
(silver) whoo talking bout silver (silver heels)  
(silver) alright (silver heels)  
I'm talkin' bout silver (silver) silver heels (silver)  
She took me out on the blackboard jungle  
Put me straight in a hurricane

"You could be my silver spring  
Blue-green colors flashin'  
I would be your only dream  
Your shinin' autumn ocean crashin'  
Don't say that she's pretty.  
And did you say that she loves you?  
Baby I don't want to know.  
  
So I'll begin not to love you  
Turn around, you'll see me runnin'  
I'll say I loved you years ago  
And tell myself you never loved me no  
Don't say that she's pretty.  
And did you say that she loves you?  
Baby I don't want to know oh no  
And can you tell me was it worth it?  
Baby, I don't want to know

But you would not let me

Will haunt you

"Intense silence  
As she walked in the room  
Her black robes trailing  
Sister of the moon  
  
And a black widow spider makes  
More sound than she  
And black moons in those eyes of hers  
Made more sense to me  
Heavy persuasion  
  
It was hard to breathe  
She was dark at the top of the stairs  
And she called to me  
And so I followed  
  
As friends often do  
I cared not for love, nor money  
I think she knew  
The people, they love her  
And still they are the most cruel  
  
She asked me  
Be my sister, sister of the moon  
Some call her sister of the moon  
Some say illusions are her game  
Wrap her in velvet  
  
Does anyone, ah, know her name  
So we make our choices  
When there is no choice  
And we listen to their voices  
Ignoring our own voice

And when we do  
I'll think about you  
How can we fail

I won't believe it baby, but I'll try  
The truth's goin' to come around

Don't think your dreams are sane  
They're taking over your life  
I stuck to you but I found out  
That you was the crazy kind  
Now way inside your heart  
Do you have a grain of love for me  
'cause all I see is decadence  
And the end of everything  
You can bend over backwards  
I ain't gonna kiss your ring  
Somebody  
I looked into your eyes  
And saw a real bad thing  
I saw desires that burned in you  
The need for power to be a king  
And I saw that you would use this world  
You know you might have to crawl  
But it's one of my eyes for one of yours  
And you'll never get no love at all
