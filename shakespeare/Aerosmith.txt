"I took a course in hallelujah  
I went to night school for the blues  
I took some stuff they said would cool ya  
But nothing seemed to light my fuse  
But it's all in the past  
Like a check that's in the mail  
She was a tall whiskey glass  
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail  
Until I met a blind man  
Who taught me how to see  
A blind man  
Who could change night into day  
And if I can  
I'm gonna make you come with me  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away  
  
I've had some lovers like a joy ride  
Some things are never what they seem  
My heaven's turned into a landslide  
I thank God I woke up from the dream  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds  
The way bees chase honey  
And drink all the flowers dry  
We'll be saving us a little money  
And if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why  
Don't make no sense lightin' candles  
There's too much moonlight in our eyes  
Because here comes the sun  
Ain't no surprise  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Gonna open up your eyes

"Checkmate honey, beat ya at your own damn game  
No dice honey, I'm livin' on the astral plane  
Feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain  
Oh, heads I win, tails you lose, to the never mind  
Where to draw the line  
An Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor  
She was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store  
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right out of me  
Oh, pass me the vile and cross your fingers, it don't take time  
Know where to draw the line  
Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs  
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long  
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime  
No dice honey, you're the salt, you're the queen of the brine  
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got to choose  
Where to draw the line  
  
Checkmate, don't be late  
Take another pull  
That's right  
Impossible  
When you got to be yourself  
You're the boss, the toss  
The price, the dice  
Grab yourself a slice  
Know where to draw the line

"Well I woke up this morning  
On the wrong side of the bed  
And how I got to thinkin'  
About all those things you said  
About ordinary people  
And how they make you sick  
And if callin' names kicks back on you  
Then I hope this does the trick  
'cause I'm sick of your complainin'  
About how many bills  
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'  
'Bout your poodles and your pills  
And I just can't see no humor  
About your way of life  
And I think I can do more for you  
With this here fork and knife  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
So I called up my head shrinker  
And I told him what I'd done  
He said you best go on a diet  
Yeah, I hope you have some fun  
And a don't go burst the bubble  
On rich folks who get rude  
'Cause you won't get in no trouble  
When you eats that kinda food  
Now they're smokin' up their junk bonds  
And then they go get stiff  
And they're dancin' in the yacht club  
With muff and uncle biff  
But there's one good thing that happens  
When you toss your pearls to swine  
Their attitudes may taste like shit  
But go real good with wine  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Believe in all the good things  
That money just can't buy  
Then you won't get no bellyache  
From eatin' humble pie  
I believe in rags to riches  
Your inheritance won't last  
So take your gray poupon my friend  
And shove it up your ass  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
Don't stop me now, I'm goin' crazy  
Eat the rich  
That's my idea of a good time baby

He was taking aim  
I was believer when you told me  
That you loved me  
And then you called me  
Someone else's name  
  
There ain't gonna be no more  
Beggin' you please  
You know what I want

Must be some kind of nouveau riche

Or some hypnotic trance  
Let's get you on a tighter leash  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
You ain't that good  
Is what you said  
Down to the letter  
But you like the way  
I hold the microphone  
Sometimes I good but  
When I'm bad I'm even badder  
Don't give me no lip  
I've got enough of my own  
  
There ain't gonna be  
No more beggin' you please  
You know what I want  
And it ain't one of these

"I got a rip in my shoes  
And a hole in my brand new shoes  
I got a Margarita nose  
And a breath full of Mad Dog Booze  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Yeah, they threw me outta jail  
I tell ya it ain't fair  
I tried to kiss the judge  
From the electrica' chair  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
The guitar's cranked  
And the bass man's blown a fuse  
And when the whole gang bangs  
Then what is your excuse?  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Fever gives you lust with an appetite  
It hits you like the fangs  
From a rattlesnake bite  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
We can't run away from trouble  
There ain't no place that far  
But if we do it right at the speed of light  
There's the backseat of my car - caviar  
I was feelin' so high I forgot what day  
Now I'm feeling low down  
Even slow feels way to fast  
And now the booze don't work  
'Cause the drugs ran out of gas  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
The buzz that you're gettin'  
From the crack don't last  
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
My first time ever lover  
We fell asleep out on the lawn  
And when I woke up I was all alone  
Making love to the crack of dawn  
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir  
The gangster of love rides again  
You know I gotta chill  
It gimme such a thrill  
Like a burnin' plague  
Yeah get outta my way  
Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear  
As long as I'm in heaven, honey I don't care  
You look so good baby, look so fine  
I tell you you're the image of a perfect crime  
You get so tired holdin' on so tight  
If you think you're goin' crazy  
Well you may be right  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight

Or wake me up with a shove  
I'm gonna knock you off your rocker, rocker

But you walked the other way

You better get it while it's hot now babe  
'Cause I can't let go

"Good evening people, welcome to the show  
Got something here I want you all to know  
When laughin' people bring on primal screams  
You got to think of what it's gonna take to make your dreams  
Make it  
Don't break it  
I said make it  
Don't break it  
Do then ya feel like the world's coming down on you  
You know that history repeats itself  
But you just learned so by somebody else  
You know you do, you gotta think up fast  
You gotta figure what it's gonna take to make it last  
Make it  
Don't fake it  
Said make it  
Don't fake it  
Better weather, pull yourself together  
Don't be catchin' the blues  
Better weather, pull yourself together  
What have you got to lose  
You're only paying your dues  
If you're gone I'll get you anyway  
Although you know what you've been going through

"It ain't easy, livin' like a gypsy.  
Tell ya, honey, how I feel.  
I've been dreaming,  
Floatin' down stream and  
Losin' touch with all that is real.  
Whole earth lover, keepin' under cover  
Never knowin' where ya been.  
You've been fadin', always out paradin'.  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
  
Well you've always got your tail on the wag.  
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon.  
You act like a perpetual drag.  
You better check it out,  
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon.  
  
It ain't easy, livin' like ya want to,  
And it's so hard to find piece of mind. Yes it is.  
The way I see it, you've got to say shit.  
But don't forget to drop me a line.  
  
Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen.  
And workin' for you dad is just a drag.  
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams.  
You better check it out,  
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon.  
  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
Tell her where you've gone and been.  
Livin' out your fantasy,  
Sleeping late and smoking tea.

"The streets were cold and barren  
The nights were dark and dank  
And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years....  
The buildings were dead and the alleys  
Stunk from things that used to live there  
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered  
  
A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his  
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence  
With not a scrap left on the plate  
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable  
Cause the only thing left was their faith  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do  
About it....  
  
There's a Meltdown in the sky  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
There's a fear that gets me high  
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by....  
  
So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold  
Made me wonder just who was the foe  
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus  
Had predicted such a long long time ago?  
You could hear screams and moanin'  
From the people atoning  
For their sins of a guilt ridden life  
And the final door shuts  
From the wind that leaves cuts  
From the edge on the blade of God's knife  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about....  
  
There's a Melt Down in the Sky  
There's a new day comin and I don't know why  
There's a tear stuck in my eye  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
  
Battle lines had been drawn  
Mother nature how she cried  
By her side, till the dawn  
Couldn't kill her if they tried  
How they tried, open eyed, genocide  
Then... She died

Hush-a-bye my baby what you do

The wrinkles on her face about to crack

You ain't goin' nowhere, unless you get that  
Monkey off your back'

I was the evil leader of the pack  
You best believe I had it all and then I blew it  
Feedin' that fuckin' monkey on my back  
If you put it a spoon man I would boot it  
Some king whose mental house was just a shack  
Where do you draw the line when all your friends are dyin'  
You got to get that monkey off your back  
Uh, uh, uh....

The changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough  
  
Love went trough such sudden change  
Taken a turn for the worst  
The joy turned to fear  
The pain got so severe  
Lord, I thought I was cursed  
  
Get what you give  
It comes around full circle  
Oh, I paid the price  
Love so fast  
I won't make the same mistake twice  
  
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many  
Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough  
Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough

Was so damn shady  
She'll say she love to talk  
A conversation  
But I'm the one  
Who makes my situation  
  
This one way city

It's just you're much too rude  
Your fruits are rotten  
  
You know I work so hard to keep it alive  
Now all I hear from you  
Is nothing but jive  
  
Lately it's been so hard  
Now to make ends meet

To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I really been feelin'  
Like I could be movin' on  
  
You're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody you meet  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody but me  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody you meet

"When I'm in heat  
Someone gets a notion  
I jump to my feet  
I hoof it to the ocean  
We hit a beach  
Where no one gives a hoot  
Nobody never ever wears a suit  
The ladies there  
They look so proud  
That's 'cause they know  
That they've been so well endowed  
  
Now, I ain't much  
For Fannie's conversation  
Or care to much  
About her operation  
But every time Pandora comes my way  
I get high  
Can't explain the sensation  
To get it on  
I gotta watch what I say  
Or I'll catch hell  
From the women's liberation

Sweet Pandora  
Good-like aura  
Smell like a flora  
Open up your door-a for me

Just for me, just for me

Just for me, just for me  
Just for me

I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
You best believe it that I got to get away

She think she kinky but she can't get straight  
She say she livin', but I kinda think she's brain dead  
Just excess baggage on a late night freight

"At first we three thought  
'Twas the biblical cord of life  
Then noticing 'twas connected to his head  
  
How strange, not to believed  
I reached out to feel, and the pony's eyes opened  
The cord got hard, the head looked around  
And you know who pushed and gushed  
The waters of life  
First two hooved feet, then the shine of his fur  
  
But at first to my eyes only  
Feather - feathers - wings  
The butterflies flew up in such colors  
Exploding all around us  
  
The rest I did not see - till there he stood - all eyes in wonder  
  
Who me - who you  
  
Look

Never thought I'd given in  
Her candle of youth was burnin' low

Live on borrowed time,  
Take the wind right out of your sail.  
  
Fireflies dance in the heat of,  
Hound dogs that bay at the moon.  
My ship leaves in the midnight,  
Can't say I'll be back too soon.  
  
They awaken far far away,  
Heat of my candle show me the way.  
Tears of a thousand drawn to her sin,  
Seasons of wither holdin' me in.  
  
Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you.  
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you.  
In time bound to lose your mind,  
Live on borrowed time,  
Take the wind right out of your sail.

"I was a city boy  
Caught up in a city way  
A nitty gritty boy  
Was out all night  
And always gettin' blown away  
  
[Chorus]  
There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love  
  
She was a city girl  
With no responsibility  
A pretty little city girl  
All fired up and what's  
That got to do to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's as clear as a  
Sunrise in Sedona  
Just what it is  
That's blowin' in the wind  
It's the fire in her eyes  
It's the tear when she cries  
Its the heat when I fall on my knees(yeah)  
That I'm thinkin' of

Its as clear as a

Don't get deep, shut up and dance  
Love has got me down  
The weight is all around  
So you lend a hand to peace on earth  
Here's my piece, now what's it worth  
Yea, but it's all right  
When you can't define the crime  
Then life ain't worth a dime  
When they take away everything you got  
And they rub your nose in the funky spot  
Not without a fight  
When you work your fingers to the bone  
And what does that get you--nothing  
If in a crowd of people  
You're still alone I hope that tells you something  
The road to heaven is paved in hell  
And it makes you wonder  
Why you're here at all  
Check out the shape of your circumstance  
He wears the dress and she wears the pants  
Here comes Jill and she needs romance  
But you can't do jack so shut up and dance!  
Sex is like a gun  
You aim, you shoot, you run  
When you're splittin' hairs with Mr. Clean  
It' like gettin' head from a guillotine  
And the night has just begun  
Talk is cheap, shut up and dance  
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

Does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web, any size  
Catches thieves just like flies  
  
Look out here comes the spiderman  
  
Is he strong, listen bud  
He's got radioactive blood  
Can he swing, from a thread  
No escape from his spider-web  
  
Look out there goes the spiderman  
  
When chill meets the night  
at the scream of a crime  
Like a stream of light  
He arrives just in time  
Look out, life is a great big bang-up  
Wherever there is a hang-up  
You'll find the spiderman.

I wanna be a Hare Krishna  
Tattoo a dot right on my head

Take me to the farm

"I never thought a first time love would ever last  
How could a kiss like that  
Knock me flat on my ass  
  
The burning bed  
The roses dead

Yeah,  
I'm missing you  
Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off of my mind  
  
Yeah,  
Your sweet talking hip shaking wobble gonna blow a man away  
Kiss butt, and guess what  
Even double crossin' dogs have their day, ha  
So forget about, regret about, you're right I ain't afraid to say  
  
Yeah, I'm missing you  
Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off  
  
And the more I try  
Leads to the same old why  
You made me slip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off of the cloud we was on  
And now it's all gone  
Tell me why, why, why, why  
Why ain't I getting through  
Ain't no lie there out of love, love, love  
  
Tell me was it good, for you  
  
Tell me what you want  
  
Yeah, cause I'm missing you  
Just like you knew I'd do  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get'choo off  
And I know I tried  
Leads to the same old why  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't, can't, can't get you

"Back when Cain was able  
Way before the stable  
Lightning shot right out from the sky  
A mothership with fate said  
Let's give it a try  
  
Conscience was related  
Man, he was created  
Lady luck took him by surprise  
Her sweet and bitter fruit  
It surely opened his eyes  
  
Well, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
Well, she ate it  
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right  
  
Even Eve in eden  
Voices tried deceivin'  
With lies to show the lady the way  
At first she stopped and turned  
And tried to walk away  
  
Man, he was believer  
Lady was deceiver  
So the story goes, but you see  
The snake was he and she just climbed right up his tree  
  
So, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
She ate it  
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right  
  
Science was related  
Man, he was created  
When lady luck took him by surprise  
Her sweet and bitter fruits  
Surely opened his eyes  
  
Evil came like rain  
And who knows who's to blame  
And something tried to lay her to waste  
And all she want to need was just a little taste  
  
So, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
Yeah, she ate it  
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right  
Well, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
Yeah, she ate it  
Never knowing wrong from right, right,  
Well that's right

"Riding a hurricane, tied to a ball and chain  
Too much of a good good thing, it kind of stops you in your tracks  
How did you ever get this far, now honey don't look back  
And you best believing that all that's good is inside of you  
Heh, inside of you, yeah  
  
Ride on a carpet ride, high on the tears you cried  
One's just too many but a thousands not enough  
And you can't make up your mind playing blind mans bluff  
And you best believing that all that's good is inside of you  
Yeah, inside of you  
  
It ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough  
Ain't enough, I got to have it now ain't it tough  
It ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough  
ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough  
Oh shit  
  
You know another touch is easy, try and reach the sky  
And though you can't get much more higher than you ever tried  
When you die you're not forsaken  
Best be taking tries of all the things that you're not taking  
  
Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough  
I got to have it ain't it tough  
I got to have it  
  
Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough  
I got to have it  
  
Ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough  
Ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough

"I kept the right ones out  
And let the wrong ones in  
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins  
There were times in my life  
When I was goin' insane  
Tryin' to walk through  
The pain  
  
When I lost my grip  
And I hit the floor  
Yeah, I thought I could leave, but couldn't get out the door  
I was so sick and tired  
Of livin' a lie  
I was wishin' that I  
Would die  
  
It's amazing  
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light  
It's amazing  
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright  
It's amazing  
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight  
  
That one last shot's permanent vacation  
And how high can you fly with broken wings?  
Life's a journey, not a destination  
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings  
  
You have to learn to crawl  
Before you learn to walk  
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah  
I was out on the street,  
Just a tryin' to survive  
Scratchin' to stay alive  
  
It's amazing  
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light  
It's amazing  
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright  
Oh, it's amazing  
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight.  
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts  
  
Never said I'll do it, never  
Never gonna go, never

Remember, the light at the end of the tunnel, may be you! Good night!)

I'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you

Don't make it tough  
I'll put away my pride  
Enough's enough  
I've suffered and I've seen the light  
  
[Chorus]  
Bayayby, you're my angel  
Come and save me tonight  
You're my angel  
Come and make it alright  
  
Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside  
Yes it's true, loneliness took me for a ride  
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar  
Without your love a dog without a bone  
What can I do? I'm sleepin' in this bed alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come and save me tonight  
You're the reason I live  
You're the reason I die  
You're the reason I give when I break down and cry  
Don't need no reason why  
Baby, baby, bayayby  
You're my angel  
Come and save me tonight  
You're my angel  
Yeah, come and make it alright  
You're my angel  
Come and save me tonight  
You're my angel  
Come and take me alright  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight

It's sorta the finer characteristic

Why I thought of that, I just  
(Baby, you have such sweet fill-up talk)  
Ya got like a little animal cracker, Discovery channel thing  
Watch the gazelle as he grazes through the open plains  
Now look, as the cheetah approaches  
Watch as he stalks his prey  
Now the gazelle is a little spooked  
He could head north to the manless peaks above or south  
The gazelle now faces mans most parlous question  
North or south way down tune in next week

That anyone else in this world  
Is doing this very same thing at this very same moment?

With the pages turned  
In your black book full of names  
And then you throw your frozen heart  
Out in somebody else's flames  
And it's a low down dirty, dirty shame.  
Don't let this love slip through the tracks  
I miss your claw marks on my back  
  
And call me your baby  
I kissed away the tears you cried  
And then you go and leave me

I believe I've always been in love with you  
Though we got caught up in the sway  
Never know in where we left  
Been off the hook and out of hand  
Sometimes I feel that love is a crime  
'Cause I remember, yeah, the very first time  
  
You call me your baby  
I kissed away the tears you cried

And he knew of another place in space and time  
He told of how me and my lady  
Could look but we would never find  
Said if you please I beg your pardon

Your life can be an avant garden  
Cause love's what makes your garden grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
Sometimes my life ain't what it's seemin'  
Right from the start it's what your heart's believin'  
Could all this just be lucid dreamin'  
But dreams just ain't enough for me  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
You know it just ain't right  
To deal with other's shite  
No one should ever be so broken hearted  
Don't never be afraid  
Cause when you got it made  
Yeah you don't even have to try  
So I'll be waiting in your garden  
Ffff...watching all your flowers grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
You'll know we've arrived  
Here inside our avant garden...yeah yeah  
The sun brings the rain  
The moon needs the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
Beware of the lies  
A word to the wise  
There's sweet cherry pies  
And truth inside our avant garden...ooh ah yea  
Do it do it  
Do it do it...

Under my skin  
You can be never more mine

But there's blood on the green  
Only god knows I'm innocent

Like the storm rules over the sea  
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone  
  
Don't dare me now  
The threatening shadows will pass by  
There're getting closer now  
Open your eyes  
Wake up my dear young friend  
And hate shall fade away  
  
I will not move, yet  
I'll stand still, instead  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield he's lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore  
  
The field's been left in sorrow  
The father and the son  
They're gone  
  
The sun shines bright  
And anger rises  
Lorn and lonely  
Torn apart  
Don't you think  
It's time to stop now  
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss  
  
Let's pray  
That heaven is on our side  
Through violence and horror  
Shall honour arise  
  
So let's pray  
And blessed shall be our leader  
We follow the noble and bright  
  
Don't you hear me crying  
Crying  
Come take me away  
I hallow thy name  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield he's lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore

Join in the horrible screams  
Take part in murderous deeds  
Renowned be the lion-hearted  
Join in the minstrelsy  
Wailing in endless grief  
It eagerly longs for more  
Broken bodies lay down on the ground  
  
Blood sheds all over the place  
The green will be stained forever  
And hate reigns all over the field  
They keep struggling on in anger  
  
Fiercely intense  
Outrageous, too blind to see  
And in pain they keep on singing  
We claim the land for the highlord  
God bless the land and our highlord  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt

Oh, runnin' with the pack  
Oh, never lookin' back  
Oh, know just where he's been  
That coney island white fish boy's  
Been there and back again  
  
Sixteen years with his boardwalk queen  
And at steeplechase, she used to wet his dreams  
She combs her hair, that flamin' jewel  
Streaked with clorox bleach  
Coney gettin' down and dirty  
Snortin' up the beach  
  
She'd be screamin' (coney)  
She'd be screamin' (coney)  
Go get 'em coney  
  
(coney), bone to bone screamin'  
(coney) she be screamin' (coney)  
Get down  
Get back in town  
Get back, get down  
Get back in town  
Get back, get down  
Coney!  
She'd be screamin' (coney)  
Best believe it (coney)

"It's the dawn of the day and I'm crashed and I'm smashed  
As it is I'm feelin' like my chips are cashed  
All of my clothes strewn all over the room  
The crisis at hand is I'm all out of zoom  
  
[Chorus:]  
I got the sunlight blues  
I can't find my shoes  
The only thing on TV  
Is the Good Morning News  
  
The tricks of the night  
Keepin' me in a daze  
Open a bottle and I'll pull down the shades  
Glance in the mirror  
Back into bed  
Forget that it's day, time to party again  
  
[Chorus]  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Give me the night  
  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Give me the night  
  
[Repeat Chorus To Fade]

"I met a babe in a backseat drive-in  
Back in the saddle she'd sit  
Pulled on the reins just to keep me risin'  
  
She loved to chomp at the bit  
Daddy do it, ooh, just do it  
Daddy do it, please let me see  
Do it, please just do it daddy  
Do it, do it, drivin' me crazy  
  
She always walks with her eyes down on her bootlace  
She lives to give it away  
She don't believe in the right time or the wrong place  
She's always liable to say  
  
(Cheese cake) Looser than her sister  
(Cheese cake) Mmm, her sugar gets me high  
She knows I can't resist her (cheese cake)  
Got my fingers in her pie (cheese cake)  
  
(Cheese cake) Sneakin' out the back door  
(Cheese cake) Rollin' down the lawn  
Everybody's kissed her (cheese cake)  
At the crack of dawn (cheese cake)

"You act like a prima donna,  
Playing so hard to get.  
Sittin' so cool and nonchalant,  
Draggin' on a cigarette.  
You keep a wall all around ya.  
I'll get through some day.  
I want your love, baby,  
Push, don't shove  
Gonna chip that stone away.  
  
Chip away,  
Chip away at the stone.  
I won't stop until your love is my very own.  
Chip away,  
That's what I'm gonna do.  
Sweet little mama,  
I wanna get next to you.  
  
You stand like a marble statue,  
Trying to look so hard.  
All decked out in your antique dress,  
While the boys all promenade.  
Even a rock will crumble,  
If you strike it night and day.  
If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust.  
Gonna chip that stone away.  
  
Chip away,  
Chip away at the stone.  
I won't stop until your love is my very own.  
Chip away,  
That's what I'm gonna do.  
Sweet little mama,  
I wanna get next to you.  
  
Chip away,  
Chip away at the stone.  
Honey, I won't stop until your love is my very own.  
Chip away,  
That's what I'm wanna do.  
Sweet little mama,  
I wanna get next to you.  
  
Yes I do, yes I do.  
  
Chip away, chip away, at the stone.  
Chip away, chip away, at the stone.

I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.

She, salty baby with the name-a

No no no, if you shake me I'll be screaming

"The street is cold, the dawn is grey  
My heart says no but my head says stay  
My work is finished, or so I've been told  
Can't part the three of us, once we got a hold  
  
I forgot the name  
I took a shot on the chin  
I'm rearranging my game  
Tell by the shape I'm in  
  
In line of fire, you know what to say  
They gave us no choices, just one shade of grey  
My legs keep movin', I don't seem to stray  
But I know each step we take, they're one step away  
  
I found the secret, the key to the vault  
We walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls  
I took the time, to feel for the door  
I found the secret, the key to it all  
  
I got the Nouveauree  
And dragged it home to bed  
I traded you for me  
I took it all and said  
  
I find my own fun,  
Sometimes for free I got to pay it to come lookin' for me  
Walkin' on Gucci,  
Wearin' Yves St. Laurent barely stay on cause I'm so God damn gaunt

Hanging from the stairs too long

"Come here, baby  
You know you drive me up the wall  
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull  
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love  
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me  
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways  
You hear me?  
  
Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train  
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood  
Girl, you been givin' me that line so many times

"Arriving in boats, black hooded coats  
Tormentors climbed into my room  
I crawled under my bed, covered my head  
But they're flushin' me out with a broom  
The leader, she's small, pinned my ass to the wall  
For my seeds or she'd be losin' her past  
Time after time, she'd be readin' my mind  
But she never got the feelin' to last  
Celebrate, celebrate, celebraid it  
This is the critical mass  
So far so good, I heard the other say  
So good so far, they're takin' me away  
I drink to you, your mind, her ass  
We'll take a drink and break the glass  
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it  
This is the critical mass  
Now the tallest of two, with a brush full of blue  
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall  
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done  
But she just ain't listenin' at all  
She points to my heart, tellin' me if I'm smart  
I'll practice and phase  
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit  
And I went screaming out down the hall  
Need it  
Need your love  
Just then I heard a poundin' on the door  
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more  
I drink to you alas, we'll take a drink and break the glass  
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it  
We are the critical mass  
Time and space, is takin' me away  
Time erase, don't know the time of day

"Now you say you lonely  
You cry the whole night through  
  
Well you can cry me a river,  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you.  
  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
  
Well you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you.  
  
Well you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you.  
  
You drove me mad and drove me out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said,  
Told me love was true for me and...  
Told me you was...you and...me and...Now you say you loved me  
Well, just to prove ya do  
  
Go on an  
Cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried a river over you...

"There was a time  
When I was so brokenhearted  
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine  
The tables have turned - yeah  
'Cause me and them ways have parted  
That kinda love was the killin' kind  
All I want is someone I can't resist  
I know - all I - need to know  
By the way I got kissed  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' just to get you  
Now I'm dryin' 'cause I let you  
Do what you do down on me  
Now there's not even breathing room  
Between pleasure and pain  
Yeah you cry when we're makin' love  
Must be one and the same  
It's down on me  
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing  
It's been on my mind, girl I gotta say  
We're partners in crime  
You got that certain something  
What you do to me takes my breath away  
Now the word out on the street  
Is the devil's in your kiss  
If our love goes up in flames  
That's a fire I can't resist  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' just to get you  
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you  
Do what you do to me  
'Cause what you got inside  
Ain't where your love should stay  
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love  
'Til you give your heart away  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' just to get you  
Now I'm dyin' just to let you  
Do what you do, what you do down on me

I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' when I met you

Do what you do down to, down to, down to  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery

"I love to look into your big brown eyes  
They talk to me and seem to hypnotize  
You say the things nobody dares to say  
And I'm not about to let you fly away  
My lover with no jet lag  
We'll stay up all night in my sleepin' bag  
You got a heart-beatin' rhythm from the subterranean  
I really love you little girl, I don't need to explain  
I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl  
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine  
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl  
'cause you and me is two of a kind  
Like deja vu I feel like I've been here  
Or somewhere else but you've been always near  
It's you that's in my dreams I'm beggin' for  
But I woke up when someone slammed the door  
So hard I fell out of bed  
Screamin' mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread  
And the moral of the story, I can testify  
I get stoned on you girl, that's the best reason why

"If you see Kay, you got to revel  
No angel wings more like the devil

If you need love with no condition  
Let's Do the Do honey I'm on a mission'  
  
Ain't no mistakin', my body's shakin'

By a Devil with a New Disguise  
The girl's so witchin', my backbone's twitchin'  
Cause down in Hell's kitchen  
The Devil's got a New Disguise  
  
If you see Kay, tell her I love her  
She did me in but I'll recover  
She said love was her desire  
All that she touched she set on fire  
She was so diss, I couldn't slay her  
She blew a kiss, I threw the dagger  
  
Ain't no mistakin', my body's shakin'  
My soul's been taken  
By a Devil with a New Disguise  
The girl's so witchin', my backbone's twitchin'  
Cause down in Hell's kitchen  
The Devil's got a New Disguise  
  
She came from the wrong side of town  
Every time she got off she gets knocked back down  
She's Heaven materialized  
She's givin' me Hell but it ain't no surprise  
She's a bit uncivilized

"Pulled into town just to check out the sites  
Chantilly Lace was head to toe in these tights

Donnez-moi un break honey then I paid the cheque  
To some psycho chick who's talkin' out the side of her neck

And cracked a smile - I was mofo suprised  
  
She's a dime store lover

"Mmm.....  
I'll tell ya little secret  
Make you wanna jump and shout  
When you talk to me in circles  
Take your foot out of your mouth  
It's hard enough to make it  
When you're livin' on the street  
And you want to tell somebody  
But you got to be discreet  
Then you catch your girlfriend  
With her skirt hiked up to here  
Honey, don't get mad, get even  
Don't get mad get even  
Don't get mad get even, yeah  
Don't get mad get even  
Say the times they be a-changing  
Though the blind lead the blind  
And you know your head is empty  
Though there's something on your mind  
Shackin' up with Lucy and when the morning comes  
You're with sally in the ally  
And the junkies and the bums  
You wonder why your girlfriend  
Has her skirt hiked up to here  
Honey, don't get mad, get even  
Don't get mad get even  
Don't get mad get even, yeah  
Don't get mad get even

Your eyes, baby...just wait till i...  
I'm gonna fuck up, mm hmm, I'm gonna kick ass  
You just wait to see what I've got in store...)  
Roll the dice get lucky  
'Cause they roll ya for a dime  
You got nothing else to lose  
If ya only loose your mind  
When pleasure that is shallow  
Causes trouble to be deep  
You've been dusted with the devil  
While he sweeps you off your feet  
Huh,  
Tell you little secret  
Make you want to jump and shout  
When you talk to me in circles  
Take your foot out of your mouth  
It's hard enough to make it  
When you're livin' on the street  
And you hate to be a wise guy  
When your feet are in concrete  
Sleeping with the dogs  
And you wake up with the fleas  
Honey, don't get mad, get even  
Don't get mad get even  
Don't get mad get even, yeah  
Don't get mad get even

"Remember when somebody tried to tell you how to walk  
And now they got the balls to tell us how we should talk  
Oh no, glove love ain't cool, I must agree  
So get outta my face, you ain't got nothin' on me  
  
Some say they do, some say they don't, I take it in stride  
And I can never get enough if I don't got to swallow my pride  
I heard it all before and then she told me, gimme some slack  
Then she smiled at me and gave me the shirt right off her back  
(And that's when I took advantage of the situation)  
  
Don't stop  
Rockin' your socks off  
Don't stop  
Knockin' their blocks off  
Don't stop  
Gettin' your rocks off

Takin' a hit, boy  
Don't stop  
Shakin' your fist, boy  
Don't stop  
I ain't got much to lose  
I'm feelin' so confused  
  
There's such a small thin line between pleasure and pain  
And when you say don't, then it's don't stop, I got to complain  
(Yeah) I think I may be gettin' real tired of all the steam  
Because it's hard to get the way you move out of my dreams  
(Got to get it while you can)  
  
Whenever you're in doubt, you got to whip it out  
When you keep hearin' no and your body says yes  
But you can't hear a word that's been said  
But you gotta confess lookin' up her address  
Got you thinkin' with your other head

"Every time when I look in the mirror  
All these lines on my face getting clearer

I know nobody knows  
Where it comes and where it goes  
I know it's everybody's sin  
You got to lose to know how to win  
  
Half my life  
Is books, written pages  
Live and learn from fools and  
From sages  
You know it's true, oh  
All the things come back to you  
  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, just for today  
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  
  
Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, just for today

"Totally outta control...(control) (control)... she owns me  
I didn't know that she'd know...(she'd know) (she'd know)... she stoned me  
I think I got it bad and I can't let it go  
I thought I knew me much better  
Autumn and cashmere all orange and green  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
Creme' de gardenia and black Vaseline  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
It's so not fair...completely inside my head  
Imagine pretending she's the book that I've read  
With a beautiful ending  
It really drives me mad I can't leave her alone  
'Cuz I won't let me forget her  
Rose colored glasses you know what that sez  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
Her sweet molass' is all mine pasque frez  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
(Yeeaaahh)...yeah  
Totally out of control she owns me  
Sweet almond eyes just to see and be seen  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
She's tasting like cherries sweet love's grenadine  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
Makes love like a rabbit to my velveteen  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
A ten with a smile like a young Norma Jean  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous...gorgeous

"Cruised into a bar on the shore

Back stage we're having the time  
Of our lives until somebody says  
'forgive me if i seem out of line'  
Then she whipped out a gun  
Tried to blow me away

Love put me wise to her love in disguise  
She had the body of a venus  
Lord, imagine my surprise

Let me take a peak dear  
(baby let me follow you down)  
Do me, do me, do me all night

Turn the other cheek dear

You were talking about your woman.  
I wish to god that you could see mine.  
You were talking about your woman.  
I wish to god, man, that you could see mine.  
Every time my little girl start to lovin',  
She bring eyesight to the blind.  
  
Lord, her daddy must have been a millionaire, cause I could tell by the way
she walked.  
Her daddy must have been a millionaire, cause I could tell by the way she
walked.  
Every time she start to lovin',  
The deaf and dumb begin to talk.  
Yeah, you know what they say.  
  
I remember one Friday morning,  
We was lying down across your bed.  
Man in the back room was dying, eyes were sad, and I stroked his head and I
said Lordy ain't she pretty, and the whole state knows she's fine.  
And every, every, every time she start to lovin', she bring eyesight to the
blind  
  
What a woman I got here.  
Lean on me baby, lean on me.  
  
Yes, I declare she's pretty, and the whole state knows she's fine.  
Man, I declare she's pretty, lordy, lordy, I declare she's fine.

the blind.

"Theres a candle burning in the world tonight  
For another child who vanished out of sight  
And a heart is broken, another prayer in vain  
Theres a million tears that fill a sea of pain

My thoughts all drift into space  
Sometimes I wonder if theres a better place

Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling  
Now the times in frightening  
Cant ignore the facts  
Theres so many people  
Just slippin through the cracks  
So many ashes are scattered  
So many rivers run dry  
Sometimes your Heaven is Hell  
and you dont know why  
(So listen)  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling, falling, falling...  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me  
Somewhere out there theres a shining light  
And I got to be with you tonight  
And with all were nowhere  
We still pay the price  
Yeah the Devil seems to get his way  
In downtown paradise  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling, falling, falling...  
Where do fallen angels go

Where do fallen angels go

"The day rolls in, the night rolls out  
Desire rules without a doubt

And when you come, it won't be late  
I guess by now, you got the score  
A little taste you want it more  
From San Antone to Marrakesh  
Yeah, when the night comes  
Everybody's gotta have flesh  
You got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat  
From the day that Eve did Adam down to Romeo and Juliet  
Everybody gotta have  
The prince of lust has met his match  
The witch has brewed her baddest batch  
His sword is sharp and hard as stone  
Her cauldron begs for one more bone  
And so my love, this story's told  
From modern times to days of old  
From Boston, Mass to Bangladesh  
Yeah, when the night comes  
Everybody's gotta have  
Flesh - it's got me all soaking wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat, yeah  
From the Mississippi River  
To the highest mountain in Tibet  
Everybody gotta have  
Flesh - you got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat

But it's never too late to start again  
  
Take another breath  
And say another prayer  
  
And fly away from here  
Anywhere, I don't care  
We'll just fly away from here  
Our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
  
We won't let them pass us by  
We'll just fly  
  
If this life, gets any harder now  
Don't ever mind, you got me by your side  
And any time you want  
We can catch a train and find a better place  
Cause we won't let nothing or no one keep getting us down  
  
Maybe you and I  
Should pack our bags and say goodbye  
  
And fly away from here  
Anywhere, I don't care  
We'll just fly away from here  
Our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
  
We won't let times pass us by  
We'll just fly

No way

To get outta town

As the circle goes  
It ain't right  
I'm uptight

And in the morning make me beg  
If I'd taken all her titty gritty  
Smack her right upside the head

Oh boy dontcha line the track  
  
Ooh, my love came tumblin' down

"I was dancing down the sidewalk  
Just some slam dunk  
That you might jive  
And I wondered then  
About his old girlfriend  
Was she still around - still alive  
  
It's been years  
Since my gears have been turning  
Since I asked her same dice dance  
How the flames of my poor heart been burning  
If it's hate then this must be romance  
  
Head first, baby  
How the good time feelin' lingers  
Oh, you can be alright  
On the wrong side of the street  
I'm so hungry for love  
I've been lickin' off all my fingers  
Oh yeah, you got to learn to  
Take the bitter with the sweet  
  
Yeah, I feel just like getting in trouble  
By the hair on her chinny-chin-chin  
And I love to get down on the stubble  
With my teeth it will taste like your grin  
  
Head first, baby  
How the good time feelin' lingers  
Oh, you can be alright  
On the wrong side of the street  
I'm so hungry for love  
I've been lickin' off all my fingers  
Oh yeah, you got to learn to  
Take the bitter with the sweet

"Met a woman, she had a man  
Couldn't help it, I had a plan  
Right around midnight he was gone  
Saw her red light, she left it on

If there's a reason for these chains  
It's like we suffer to ease the pain  
Now I got this feelin' inside of me  
My heart's in jail and I can't break free  
And oh my heart's done time

"What a stormy night, when I met the pony,  
It was so dark, that I could hardly see,  
It smelled so sweet, you know who and Joanie,  
So many butterflies, one could not see...  
We all could feel desire, took off in flight,  
It was hotter than fire, then came the light.  
I smell the heat, the dancing ponies,  
Unwrapped his wings, to dry off Joanie,  
The pony he grew in size, the thunder and rain,  
And finally realized, what was, what it does, and what it come to say.  
Love to kiss the cheek of mother nature, nobody here can deni such things,  
Make the ladies you love come honey, no butterfly should be denied its
wings...  
He was kick ass rocking horse! He was like a hell bent tied to the Gavin pole,  
He was a one time fantasy, I got the bare bones riding to the Holy Land,  
Bare backed, riding like a running man, nightmares,  
And he can't hold the candle to my dreams!  
We rode the night, and took to wing, it was so all right, it was everything,  
We flew into burning skies, the thunder and rain, and finally realized,  
What it is, what it does, and what it come to say!  
No, no, no, no, took off in flight,  
No, no, no, no, then came the light.  
Flashback, somethings coming over me, no sweat one time fanatsy.  
Bare bones all in the wind it seems, hell, who's the chick,  
That rides into my dreams?  
No Libury,  
No stablize,  
No one try to please,  
Nobody's eyes.  
We'll never see us again, tell me when it passed,  
Let it all begin, but all of that time, somebody shot an arrow...  
Being tempted by the time is never,  
Breaking me cause your cold sometimes...  
Being seduced by your own pleasures,  
Being king on your own time...  
He was a kick ass rocking horse, he was a...  
One horn, unicornucopia,  
Two, two in utopia,  
Three star, verge in to infinity,  
Four, four, ya... yaa hoo...

"Long ago in days untold  
Were ruled by lords of greed  
Maidens fared with gold they dared  
To bare their wombs that bleed  
Kings and queens and guillotines  
Taking lives denied  
Starch and parchment laid the laws  
When bishops took the ride  
Only to deceive  
Oh I know I  
Lived this life afore  
Somehow I know now  
Truths I must be sure  
Tossin', turnin', nightmares burnin'  
Dreams of swords in hand  
Sailing ships, the Viking spits  
The blood of father's land  
Only to deceive  
Living times of knights and mares  
Raising swords for maidens fair  
Sneer at death, fear only loss of pride  
Living other centuries  
Deja vu or what you please  
Follows true to all who do or die  
Screams of no reply  
They died  
Screams of no reply  
And died  
Died  
Lordy, Lordy, they died

"Finders keepers losers weep  
Down on 42nd street  
Bare-foot-children cryin' my-oh-my  
I watched you on the avenue  
While other men were having you  
I think that you should led your caged bird fly  
  
And kiss your past good-bye  
Kiss your past good-bye  
Kiss your past good-bye  
Kiss your past good-bye  
  
I've been so lost I must confess  
I've had my share of loneliness  
But yeah it's hard to keep a good man down  
The loves you lost were all in vain  
The past lives on inside your brain  
I don't think you need those memories  
Hangin' 'round, yeah  
Good-bye  
  
Kiss your past good-bye  
You've gotta let if fly  
Kiss your past good-bye, yeah  
And if that bird don't fly away  
There's just one thing I got to say  
It's later than deuce a ticks  
Your broken heart, it needs a fix  
You're feedin' off a high that would not last  
And people they don't seem to care  
And sorry just don't cut it, yeah  
It seems to me you're gettin' nowhere fast  
  
So, kiss, your, past  
Or kiss your ass good-bye  
Kiss your past good-bye  
There's no more tears to cry  
So kiss your past good-bye  
Or kiss your ass good-bye  
Yeah

"Take me back to a south Tallahassee  
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy  
Can't stand up on my feet in the city  
Got to get back to the real nitty gritty  
  
Yes sir, no sir  
Don't come close to my  
Home sweet home  
Can't catch no dose  
Of my hot tail poon-tang sweatheart  
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse  
From a J Paul Getty and his ear  
With a face in a beer  
Home sweet home  
  
Get out in the field,  
Put the mule in the stable  
Ma, she's a cookin'  
Put the eats on the table  
Hate's in the city and my love's in the meadow  
Hand's on the plow and my feets in the ghetto  
  
Stand up, sit down  
Don't do nothin'  
Ain't no good when boss man's stuffin'  
Down their throats with paper notes  
As babies cry  
When you're rockin' the street  
Home sweet home  
  
Mamma take me home sweet home  
I was the last child, just a punk in the street.

"Legendary child  
I tell ya what I'm talkin' about  
  
Makin' love at seventeen, yeah, we had the luck  
But we traded 'em toys and other joys, and we didn't give a (whoa-oh-oh)  
I took a chance at the high school dance, never knowing wrong from right  
And that same show, forty years ago, being televised tonight  
  
'Cause journey from inside my head to the Taj Mahal  
I went from never-havin'-none to wanna-have-it-all  
I wanna keep that dream alive  
And eat that honey from the hive  
With all the noise and all the glamor  
No surprise you know I am a  
  
Legendary child  
I think that what I'm tryin' to say is  
  
Sticks and stones will break your bones, at least they'll rearrange  
I drop a dime and every time I get myself a nickel's change (whoa-oh-oh)  
They say we don't know jack  
At the plant, we proved 'em wrong  
We traded in our souls at night and sold 'em for a song  
  
And if Satan had a lady friend, her name was Mary Jane  
I never wondered why she tried to drive us quite insane  
And how we got the golden fleece  
From tokin' on that pipe of peace  
Yeah, as far as I can see  
There is a God 'cause I got me a  
  
Legendary child  
Legendary child  
  
(Le-gen-da-ry child) Legendary child  
Legendary child  
  
Legend

"Rock-a-bye baby if you want to dance  
Grab yourself a body and take a chance  
They say one time around is all you get  
But I'm still dancin' so you lost your bet  
I got a hardcore mama with a hot hoochie coo  
Make my wheels start spinnin' like a formula two  
I got one for the money  
Two for the show  
Three for my honey  
And four to let you know that I  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Cheesecake maybe if I take another bite  
I'm a real fat city I'm an aero delight  
Threw out my pipe and my alcoline  
Got a squeaky clean body and a dirty mind  
I'm a real fine dancer I'll be cutting rug  
Got my brand new baby she's my brand new drug

"
"Johnny come lately on a Saturday night  
Singin' how-de-do  
Backstreet boogie in the house of delight  
Where they steal the show  
The money come sour but the ladies are sweet  
And it's a love affair  
Whole place rockin', people stompin' their feet  
When the gang's all there  
He gets his lovin' every night for free  
He's out there rockin' like you wouldn't believe  
I sing na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
Johnny liked to gamble with his lady Louise  
She was a blackjack deuces are wild  
He got to thinkin' 'bout his nose in the breeze  
Johnny looked and he smiled  
He started thinkin' bout the fortune and fame  
And the young girls down at his knees  
He dug the money but forgot all the names  
So he knew just how to appease  
Lick and a promise  
Lick and a promise  
Lick and a promise  
He gave the ladies a lick and a promise  
Loose change clover in his early early years  
Had his poor mama pacin' the floors  
He grabbed a guitar and a couple of beers  
Now the crowd keeps screamin' for more

"Boo yah  
There's a place in the way outta sphere  
Do ya  
Want to burn the midnight oil  
Does it fool ya  
When you think there's no way out of here  
Let it pull ya  
From the outside to within  
  
[Chorus:]  
The light inside is burning bright  
The light makes everything all right  
The light inside is burning bright  
The light inside oh yeah alright  
  
May I  
Introduce you to my point of view  
Me, I  
Want to get under your skin  
I want to thank you  
For the pleasure that I get from you  
I want to drag you  
From the outside to within'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The light inside is burning  
The light inside is burning  
The light inside is burning bright  
The light inside oh yeah alright

"Boys, it looks, are ready to rumble  
The word on the street some heads are gonna tumble  
Blades gonna flash when streets gang clash  
In the avenue tonight  
  
When the lightning strikes  
Zip gun Johnny's finger is itchin'  
The lid's gonna blow up in hell's kitchen  
It's an eye for an eye  
And a tooth for a tooth  
It's so ruthless when they fight  
  
When the lightning strikes  
And it's free for all in the parking lot  
And who'll rule the street  
And the night explodes  
When the cops bring down the heat  
  
And the chains they crash like thunder  
While the weak ones all retreat  
Gotta draw first blood  
Or they'll read your funeral rights  
  
When the lightning strikes  
It's dog eat dog when you meet your rival  
And the combat zone it's your means of survival  
Gonna get last licks on a suicide blitz  
With a broken dagger knife  
When the lightning strikes  
  
And it's free for all in the parking lot  
And who'll rule the street  
And the night explodes  
When the cops bring down the heat  
  
And the chains they crash like thunder  
While the weak ones all retreat  
Gotta draw first blood  
Or they'll read your funeral rights  
  
Oh, oh...  
When the lightning strikes  
When the lightning strikes  
When the lightning strikes  
Lightning and thunder  
When the lightning strikes...

"I was walkin' down the street  
When someone called my name  
She had spiked heels on her feet  
And she was feelin' no pain  
  
Ohhh must be Lizard Love  
So I hid behind the newspaper  
Turned to page six  
She was in her birthday suit  
Behind a crucifix  
  
Ohhh must be Lizard Love  
She was hangin' big booty  
She was puss n' boots way up to here  
She's a little bit of heaven, a 24-7  
A 10 every day of the year  
  
Now there must be some mistake  
I'm feelin' so high strung  
She said 'I make love like a snake  
I even got a forked tongue'  
  
At first I thought I was dreamin'  
That I'd wake up and she'd disappear  
But when I opened up my eyes  
She was laughing and a screamin' swinging from the chandlier  
  
You know I never seem to give  
Or ever get enough  
And I just can't seem to live without  
That sweet bodacious stuff  
  
Ohhh must be Lizard Love
