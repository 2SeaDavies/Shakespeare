"1.  
  
You got me sitting up on the shelf  
While you're out bewitching someone else.  
Do I live, Do I die  
Do I laugh, Do I cry  
What game am I supposed to loose this time?  
  
2.  
  
You got chains attached to my head  
You spreading magic honey all in your bed  
What is it you want?  
Just a puppet that talks  
Or maybe just a lover who makes love to the Dead.  
  
Step onto the stage... Just a few more minutes...  
Let's see what kind of juggler you really are.  
Say without that whip and those Bloody Boots  
Which are rented... You actually could become  
A morning star...  
But you rang your last bell  
Even your planets, they've gone to hell  
And your world turns to nothing but a bubble  
In a shotgun jar.  
And now you don't know who you really are.  
  
3.  
  
So instead of trying to make me your slave  
Why don't you just... Call it a day.  
Either way I'm gonna win  
So save yourself some wind  
Don't make me to be the last to see  
You to your grave...  
Well well, Ball and Chain... For sale.  
New day come... Masters gone to Hell...  
Well well, Ball and Chain... For sale.  
Sunrise come... Master's dying in Hell...

I remember the first time I saw you  
The tears in your eyes oh that girl's tryin' to say  
Oh little girl you know I could love you  
But first I must make my getaway

Down against the road my worry knees  
Off to the side I fall but I hear her sweet call  
My gypsy eyes fine and I've been saved  
Oh I've been saved  
That's why I love you  
I said I love you

Down, down, down.  
  
Well I asked my friend where is that black smoke comin' from  
He just coughed and changed the subject and  
said oh wa I think it might snow some  
So I left him sippin' his tea an' I jumped in my chariot  
And rode off to see just why and who could it be this time  
  
Sisters and brothers daddys mothers standin' 'round cryin'  
When I reached the scene the flames were makin' a ghostly whine  
So I stood on my horse's back an' I screamed without a crack  
I say oh baby why'd you burn your brother's house down  
  
Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey !  
  
Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord  
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down  
Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord  
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down down  
  
Well someone stepped from the crowd he was nineteen miles high  
He shouts retired and disgusted so we paint red through the sky  
I said the truth is straight ahead so don't burn yourself instead  
Try to learn instead of burn, hear what I say, yeah, yeah  
  
So I fin'ly rode away but I'll never forget that day  
'Cause when I reached the valley I looked way down cross the way  
A giant boat from space landed with eerie grace  
And came and taken all the dead away  
  
Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey !  
  
What'd I say  
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord  
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down

"The story of jesus  
So easy to explain  
After they crucified him,  
A woman, she claimed his name  
The story of jesus  
The whole Bible knows  
Went all across the desert  
And in the middle, he found a rose  
  
There should be no questions  
There should be no lies  
He was married ever happily after  
All the tears we cry  
No use in arguing  
All the use to the man that moans  
When each man falls in battle  
His soul it has to roam  
Angles of heaven  
Flying saucers to some,  
Made easter sunday  
The name of the rising sun  
  
The story is written  
By so many people who dared,  
To lay down the truth  
To so very many who cared  
To carry the cross  
Of jesus and beyond  
We will guide the light  
This time with a woman in our arms  
We as men  
Can't explain the reason why  
The woman's always mentioned  
At the moment that we die  
All we know  
Is God is by our side,  
And he says the word  
So easy yet so hard  
  
I wish not to be alone,  
So I must respect my other heart  
Oh, the story  
Of jesus is the story  
Of you and me  
No use in feeling lonely,  
I am searching to be free  
  
The story  
Of life is quicker  
Than the wink of an eye  
The story of love  
Is hello and goodbye  
Until we meet again

I just want to see.  
  
So where do I purchase my ticket?  
I'd just like to have a ringside seat  
I want to know about the new Mother Earth  
I want to hear and see everything  
I want to hear and see everything  
I want to hear and see everything  
Yeah...  
  
Aww, shucks  
If my daddy could see me now  
Everything, everything, everything, oh everything.

"(June 7, 1969)  
  
1.  
I feel the ocean swaying me ...  
washing away all my pains.  
See where I was wounded,  
Remember the scar ?  
Now you can't see a thing ...  
And I feel no pain --  
  
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets  
Green and blue ... Canyons too  
Singing about Atlantis love songs.  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.  
  
2.  
  
Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining  
Telling me where I came from --  
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he  
lays in -- ... on the Burning  
edge Horizon.  
  
I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ...  
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam --  
See the wind make love to all  
the ocean ... Joy spread and  
the massage got home --  
  
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ...  
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord  
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising --  
  
3.  
  
Look out East coast, but you're  
gonna have a neighbor,  
A rebirth land ...  
the praying Burning Sands.  
  
We know there were worlds  
so much older ...  
And they shall rise, and  
tell us much more the truth of man --  
  
4.  
  
I see visions of sleeping peaks  
erupting ...  
releasing all hell that  
will shake the Earth from end to end --  
And this ain't bad news, good news,  
or any news ... it's just the truth,  
Better save your souls while  
you can --  
  
Singing about the New Valleys  
of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean,  
the world is gonna be ...  
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ...  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.
