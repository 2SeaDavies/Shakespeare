"I'm so far away from everything you know  
Your name is carried, carried on the wind  
Oh your ice blue waters Anya, where do they flow?  
Where have they been? Ah where have they been?  
A hidden passion touching a spark  
Flame of revolution burning wild in your gypsy heart  
Oh your gypsy heart  
Anya Anya the spirit of freedom  
Anya Anya ooh Anya  
  
The light of freedom buried deep within your soul  
Across the puszta plain to see  
The rhapsody of angels refuse to dance alone  
What do they mean? Oh what do they mean?  
Your jewel flashing across the dark  
Forbidding distance, I love your gypsy heart  
Oh your gypsy heart  
Anya Anya the spirit of freedom  
Anya Anya ooh Anya  
  
Jewel flashing across the dark  
Forbidding distance, I love your gypsy heart  
Oh your gypsy heart  
Anya Anya the spirit of freedom  
Anya Anya ooh Anya

"I read in the news  
That the average man  
Is uplifted five times a day  
I'm confused  
I have to confess  
My feelings never goes away  
I know it's right  
They asked the average man  
In a survey across the nation  
I can't understand the average man  
Keeps losing his concentration  
  
Oh you gotta use it  
Oh you gonna lose it  
  
I'm just begun  
When you're all done  
I see you running down the road  
Can't hear a thing  
My mind is blasted  
And my head is about to explode  
Feeling the pain  
Just more of the same  
As we rolling through the night  
Going so fast  
We're sure to hit the next town  
Before the last one's out of sight  
  
Oh you gotta use it  
Oh you gonna lose it  
  
Back to back  
One on one  
Shake it up  
Move it on  
Back to back  
One on one  
Turn it up  
Hold it down

"Take a look at  
These dirty hands  
Take a look at this face these blazing eyes  
Do you see me as a broken man  
Tell me  
Are you really that blind  
  
You got yourself a load of trouble now  
You got yourself a bad deal  
You say I've got a bad attitude  
How d'you think I feel  
  
You got me locked in a paper cage  
You think I'm chained up but I'm just tied down  
Step aside get out of my way  
I won't hurt you I had enough being pushed around  
  
You got yourself a load of trouble now  
You got yourself a bad deal  
You say I've got a bad attitude  
How d'you think I feel  
  
Don't want a number

Take a look at my face  
Talk about a bad attitude  
Things have got to change

"Oh the beggar on his cornerstone  
Catches pity in his wrinkled hand  
But the lover whose bird has flown  
Catches nothing only grains of sand  
  
All the children in the distant house  
They have feelings only children know  
But the lover whose bird has flown  
Catches nothing only flakes of snow  
  
The sensation is not new to you  
It's something we all have known  
You get it - it goes right through you  
Yes it's something we all have known  
  
And the bird it has flown  
To a place on it's own  
Somewhere all alone  
  
Now the hermit in his lonely cave  
Has himself to keep him company  
But the lover whose bird has flown  
He has heartaches same as you and me

"Black night is not right,  
I don't feel so bright,  
I don't care to sit tight.  
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line  
that I'm free, free to be me.  
Black night is a long way from home.  
  
I don't need a dark tree,  
I don't want a rough sea,  
I can't feel, I can't see.  
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line  
that I'm free, free to be me.  
Black night is a long way from home.

Black night is a long way from home.

"I see reflections in the water  
Autumn colours, summer's daughter  
And as as the year is growing older  
I see winter on my shoulder  
I stand in the haze  
Watching stormy ripples grow on my own  
Never knew your needed  
Till I found myself standing here alone  
  
And in the water, such a sad face  
Slowly drowning, such a sad face  
If only I could change the seasons  
Like a poet, I've my reasons  
It started to snow in the middle of July  
Wonder why  
Never did understand you  
My sorrow is hanging in the grey sky  
  
In the summer days we flew to the sun  
On melting wings  
But the seasons changed to fast  
Leave us all behind  
Blind  
  
But then the stone fell on the water  
Putting end to summer's daughter  
And me, I turn away remembering  
All the seasons, such a sad thing  
It started to rain in the middle of the sun  
Winter's begun  
  
Never did understand you  
My sorrow is hanging in the grey sky  
  
In the summer days we flew to the sun  
On melting wings  
But the seasons changed to fast  
Leave us all behind  
Blind

"Woke up this morning, rain coming down  
Washing the sin from the street  
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing ground  
Just trying to make ends meet  
Well I work every day to sweat out my dreams  
Won't you show me that you understand  
It's only my life, whatever that means  
And you've got it all in your hands  
  
I need someone to pull me through  
Won't you take the pain from my head  
Give me all your loving, the way you always do  
Give me breakfast in bed  
  
I feel like the good days are numbered  
And my nights are getting too long  
My hopes and my fears take their toll on the years  
And my willpower's almost gone  
Well it's a time full of trouble  
A time of desperate need  
Sometimes life don't make sense  
Fighting the anger, jealousy and greed  
One day I'll look back and wonder where it all went  
  
I need someone to pull me through  
Won't you take the pain from my head  
Give me all your loving, the way you always do  
Give me breakfast in bed  
  
It don't take much to please me  
I'm just a simple man  
Won't you please believe me  
I gotta tell you  
It don't take much, a tender touch  
So baby do the best that you can

"The sky is red, I don't understand,  
past midnight I still see the land.  
People are sayin' the woman is damned,  
she makes you burn with a wave of her hand.  
The city's a blaze, the town's on fire.  
The woman's flames are reaching higher.  
We were fools, we called her liar.  
All I hear is ""Burn!""  
  
I didn't believe she was devil's sperm.  
She said, ""Curse you all, you'll never learn!  
When I leave there's no return.""  
The people laughed till she said, ""Burn!""  
Warning came, no one cared.  
Earth was shakin', we stood and stared.  
When it came no one was spared.  
Still I hear ""Burn!""

"You know I'm not your lover now  
It might as well be said  
And then you say you're leaving  
Or maybe I'm just hanging on a thread  
When I gave you everything  
It didn't seem that much  
You gave me your opinion  
With the usual heavy handed touch  
  
What can I do  
About the rain that falls on you  
I'm not your lover now  
I'm not your lover now  
  
What can I do  
About the rain that falls on you  
I'm not your lover now  
I'm not your lover now  
  
My head is spinning endlessly  
My sense won't react  
Then I'm falling through a black hole  
Part of me is never coming back  
  
How you can lose a thing  
You never really had  
And you always hurt the one you love  
And you just love to hurt me bad  
  
What can I do  
About the rain that falls on you  
I'm not your lover now  
I'm not your lover now  
  
What can I do  
About the sky that falls on you  
I'm not your lover  
  
You really must be going now  
By god, is that the time?  
Let me put you out of my misery  
They call it being cruel to be kind  
I only insult my friends my friend  
The rest can go to hell  
You can read it anyway you want  
Oh well, you're not so bad yourself  
  
What can I do  
About the rain that falls on you  
I'm not your lover now  
I'm not your lover now

"Chasing shadows, over my walls  
with myself hardly sleeping  
Dwarfs and giants, twenty feet tall  
fill the room with their creeping  
  
Sounds of breathing sharpen my ears  
then they fade into nothing  
Someone's laughter out in the street  
fills the night with their loving  
  
I feel the ice in my head  
Running its hands through my bed  
Not even dreaming I seem to be dead  
Colours of yellow and colours of red  
  
All I'm asking some secret voice  
Is to lead me to darkness  
  
I'm so tired, dawn never comes  
I just hide in the shadows

I feel I ought to tell you  
But it's clearly quite absurd  
  
Wouldn't it be wonderful  
If you could read my mind  
Imagine all the stuff  
That we could leave behind  
  
How many words you waste  
Before you're understood  
Or simply sow some seeds  
You'd do it if you could  
  
Let me take a moment  
Of your time  
Inside you mind  
  
I know what you're thinking  
But I don't know what to say  
The turmoil and the conflict  
You don't have to feel that way  
  
Look into my eyes  
And feel my hand upon your heart  
Holding us together  
Not tearing us apart  
  
How many words we waste  
To justify a crime  
Compare it to an act of love  
That really takes no time  
  
Why not take a moment  
Of your time  
Inside your mind

Didn't recognize the car

There is no sense of reason  
In a reasonable world  
Makes any sense at all  
To a reasonable girl  
She said you know what I mean  
But I couldn't understand  
Didn't know what she said  
I'm a reasonable man  
It wasn't meant that way  
I was only having fun  
She looked me in the eye  
But the damage was done  
I got the vague impression  
She was under my thumb  
I looked the other way  
And I had to succumb

Girls like that  
I like girls like that

If you are young the message can be sung

Hallelujah  
  
Oh, tell it to the man who's power is the sermon on the wall  
Tell it to the man who says you can misjudge them all  
Tell it 'till it can be heard above the wailing of the crowd  
Tell it on the field of war and hope you'll soon be justified  
  
There is a better way of life and it's not so hard to find  
If you live and let the people in your world speak it's mind  
  
I am the pupil who sells his life for freedom  
All over the world and it can be heard  
If you are young the message can be sung

Her fires were burning  
She was pouring on the oil  
I do not jest, she really took me to the cleaners

Some woman  
She's a hard lovin' woman  
Some woman  
A hard lovin' woman

It turned into a laugh  
It ended with a scream  
I said 'enough's enough'  
Never heard a word  
She wouldn't let go  
A man's a man and every woman ought to know  
And there I was  
And she was dancing  
Some woman  
Here we go again

A hard lovin' woman

And you're playing on my strings  
In mysterious ways

Beyond my reach  
So far away  
But it seems  
Like only yesterday  
  
I'm Haunted  
Haunted  
Is that what you wanted  
  
All that's left  
Is the ghost of your smile  
It stays awhile  
Then fades away  
  
I hear your footsteps on the ground  
Tempting me to turn around  
It's just the echo  
Of a disenchanted lover  
Shuffling aimlessly  
Homeward bound  
  
To empty rooms  
And picture frames  
And Friends  
Who can't recall our names  
  
I'm Haunted  
Haunted  
Is that what you wanted  
  
All that's left  
Is the ghost of your smile  
It stays awhile  
Then fades away

"Big Betty or Two-tone Annie his hair was never right  
He used to be cool with a glint in his eye but he lost it overnight  
Spinning would change and things are rearranged and then Annie says to me  
Nothing wrong with the way it was that's the way it's meant to be  
  
Up the revolution we're all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay

The cigarette was cool and all the kids in school could read and count to ten

He never could make us understand what the rebellion was all about  
  
Up the revolution we're all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There's gonna be Hell, yeah, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay

Another plan put your head in the sand live to fight another day  
  
Up the revolution we're all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell

"When I was younger, so much younger than today  
I never needed anybody's help in any way  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured  
Now I find I've changed my mind, opened up the door  
  
Help me if you can I'm feeling down,  
But I do appreciate your being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please help me?  
  
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze  
But every now and then I feel so insecure  
Now I know I need you like I've never done before  
  
Help me if you can I'm feeling down,  
But I do appreciate your being 'round me  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please help me, my love?  
  
(Help) I need somebody  
(Help) Not just anybody  
(Help) I need someone  
  
Won't you please help me, my love?  
Help me baby, help me

"Called to Madonna  
To give me a line  
She said boy what have you done  
Passing your time with a holy man  
Talking about the moon and sun  
But I can't tell the difference  
Between the fool and wise  
Show me a river to follow  
Away from all these lies  
  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been picking up my bones too long  
Won't you understand  
  
Called to the captain  
To put me ashore  
For it looked like no man's land  
Is this the way to follow  
I cried as I shook his hand  
He told me had no answer  
He didn't really hold the key  
I am a simple man  
Was all he said to me  
  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me a hand  
I've been out in the cold too long  
Won't you understand  
I've been on the road so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been out in the cold too long  
Won't you understand  
  
Heard my mother crying  
She was calling out my name  
Whisper in the dark night  
Saying who's to blame  
The hour glass keeps turning  
With not enough sand to see  
I am a holy man  
So don't you bother me  
  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been pickin' up my bones too long  
Won't you understand  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been out in the cold too long  
Won't you understand?

"I got a certain little girl she's on my mind  
No doubt about it she looks so fine  
She's the best girl that I ever had  
Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad  
  
Hush, hush  
I thought I heard her calling my name now  
Hush, hush  
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now  
Hush, hush  
Thought I heard her calling my name now  
Hush, hush  
I need her loving and I'm not to blame now  
  
(Love, love)  
They got it early in the morning  
(Love, love)  
They got it late in the evening  
(Love, love)  
Well, I want that, need it  
(Love, love)  
Oh, I gotta gotta have it  
  
She's got loving like quicksand  
Only took one touch of her hand  
To blow my mind and I'm in so deep  
That I can't eat and I can't sleep  
  
Listen  
Hush, hush  
Thought I heard her calling my name now  
Hush, hush  
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now  
Hush, hush  
Thought I heard her calling my name now  
Hush, hush

"I keep singing the same old song  
Like I did before  
When you left me  
You left me in darkness  
I'd never known before  
I was restless  
A fool for your time  
Waiting 'round for you to call  
But now I've found me  
An angel of mercy  
I don't feel bad at all  
  
Your body was honey  
I tasted a lot  
But let me tell you babe  
I need more than you got  
I want someone to hold me  
An' keep me satisfied  
I need love  
  
I've got nothing to do  
Ain't got nothing to say  
Just live your life  
The way you know  
When you moved on  
You took all the sweetness  
Was I a fool to let you go  
With the woman I forget for the moment  
All the times we knew before  
Tho I'm still singing  
The same old love song  
I don't want you knocking on my door

"On the lonely road I'm travelling on  
The road that leads nowhere  
As the ground and the sky have been wondering why  
I'm alone, so alone  
  
I've been rolling on for just two years  
The sun is my only friend  
With the wind on the bend and my back in my hand  
I'm alone, so alone  
I'm alone, so alone  
I'm alone, so alone  
I'm alone, so alone  
And I feel like going home  
  
With my money spent, my clothes all torn  
My spirit hanging low  
I ain't got no friends where the highway ends  
I'm alone, so alone  
I'm alone, so alone  
I'm alone, so alone  
I'm alone, so alone  
And I feel like going home  
Going home

"Take the trouble to decide the things you do  
Will not be the things that don't appeal to you  
See the mess your makin' can't you see your fakin'  
Gonna make it hard for you, you're gonna - into the fire  
  
Turn on the mandrake that was given to you  
See if you can make it like the others do  
Feel the blood a knockin' when you're finger poppin'  
Gonna make it hard for you, you're gonna - into the fire  
  
Stop your bleeding mind before it's over and done  
Listen very closely to the message I've sung  
Feel the blood a knockin' when you're finger poppin'  
Gonna get a message through, you're gonna - into the fire

"So many signs  
So many ways  
It's a living thing  
No need to rush  
The buzz will last for days

I'm just a man  
Take it girl  
Or leave it  
Don't be reading out the label on the can  
  
I got your number  
I got your number  
I got your number  
  
I'll be your lover  
I'll be your friend  
I'll be your friend  
And your brother in love  
But that's where the story ends  
  
If you say jump  
I'll do it with affection  
But don't get pissed  
If I don't move  
Too fast in your direction  
  
I got your number  
I got your number  
I got your number  
  
It's that same old nonsense  
That same old look  
But now I'm turning back  
And I can read you like a book  
It all means nothing  
Nothing at all  
It's the same old business  
Man it drives me up the wall  
  
You made the potion too strong  
I feel I'm going soft  
I've been that way far too long  
You see, now it's wearing off  
  
So many times  
So many days  
It's a spiritual thing  
That loving touch  
I thought you'd be amazed  
  
I like the distance  
I like the space  
The money's good  
The rent is cheap  
And I can read suspicion on your face  
  
I got your number  
I got your number  
I got your number

"There's no method in my madness, no craft, no guile  
No expertise, no self assuring smile  
No wizardry or witchcraft, no crass deceit  
No dark conspiracies, I stand on my own two feet  
I'm coming through just like jack ruby  
  
I ragged around the edges but I got control  
There's no way around it and I got control  
I reach out for my program, still got control  
Straight down to business, who needs control  
I've got panache just like jack ruby  
  
I don't beg forgiveness, I don't beg at all  
But I beg to differ 'cause I got the ball  
There was no invitation, you're not my type  
And what's gone, it ain't worth having, kiss it all goodbye  
Right on the money just like jack ruby

"Broken down relations, beaten up guitars  
Making one last appearance in a heap of old cars  
Brambles and weeds flourishing amongst  
Lines of empty bottles and rambling drunks  
  
Junkyard blues sounds familiar  
I'm never alone  
Always remind me of home  
  
Once of a dozen covered with stains  
Blistered and stinking was all that remained  
Cannibalized machines, mysterious bones  
Unwanted contents of anonymous homes  
  
Those junkyard blues sounds familiar  
Take me back  
Always remind me of home  
  
Mangy old dog scratching in the dust  
Burned out Mercedes surrendering to rust  
All this stuff was good for something  
But here it is now, good for nothing  
  
Junkyard blues sounds familiar  
I'm never alone  
Always remind me of home

Kentucky woman  
If she get to know you  
She goin' to own you

"I threw a rock in the lake and it sank to the bottom  
The waves spread out but the rock got forgotten  
The ripples came back just as we feared  
Looking for the rock but the hole disappeared  
It's somewhere in the middle some ways down  
The last guy that went looking almost certainly drowned  
  
He ran out of time  
He can kiss tomorrow goodbye  
  
Yes I piss in the water and burn down the trees  
I watch as the creatures fall to their knees  
They ain't got a clue as disaster looms  
They're too busy choking on toxic fumes  
They got no hope and there's no point running  
No matter what they do I keep on coming  
  
They ran out of time  
They can kiss tomorrow goodbye  
  
I did a bad thing  
I did a bad thing  
I did a bad thing  
I did a bad thing  
  
Well hallelujah and holy mackerel  
All we got left is a thief and a jackal  
The writing is big and it's there on the wall  
Oh how the mighty empires fall  
There's nothing to fix it's much too late  
Sit down and prepare to meet your fate  
  
You have ran out of time  
Kiss tomorrow goodbye

"Sweet Lucy was a dancer  
But none of us would chance her  
Because she was a Samurai  
She made electric shadows  
Beyond our fingertips  
And none of us could reach that high  
She came on like a teaser  
I had to touch and please her  
Enjoy a little paradise  
The log was in my pocket  
When Lucy met the Rocket  
And she never knew the reason why  
  
I can't deny it  
With that smile on her face  
It's not the kill  
It's the thrill of the chase  
  
Feel it coming  
It's knocking at the door  
You know it's no good running  
It's not against the law  
The point of no return  
And now you know the score  
And now you're learning  
What's knockin' at your back door  
  
Sweet Nancy was so fancy  
To get into her pantry  
Had to be the aristocracy  
The members that she toyed with  
At her city club  
Were something in diplomacy  
So we put her on the hit list  
Of a common cunning linguist  
A master of many tongues  
And now she eases gently  
From her Austin to her Bentley  
Suddenly she feels so young

It's one long party and I haven't seen the sun for days  
I'd take you out tonight, but I'm just a little light  
So let's go out anyway, you'll be amazed  
  
I take my woman to the palace dancing  
I never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine  
So I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe  
You can pay the bill and while you're at it pick up mine  
Oh, no no, I don't mind  
  
If it rains I stay inside  
If I'm scared I run and hide  
I'm not responsible, oh no

"Cold beer and a strange cigarette  
Getting you high getting you wet  
Falling in love falling out of debt  
Straight gay black or white  
Strutting in the dark hiding in the light  
Doing it wrong doing it right just doing it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other  
I got the right we all got the right  
  
One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck  
One man's meat is someone's empty well  
One man's meat is some guy's aching butt  
One man's meat is another man's living hell  
  
Short fat thick or thin  
Take it in the gut take it on the chin  
Living in glory living in sin  
Hard day's work going down slow  
Riding the road where the green grass grows  
Watching in die what d'you know  
Watch it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other  
I got the right  
  
One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck  
One man's meat is someone's empty well  
One man's meat is some guy's aching butt  
One man's meat is another man's living hell

"Changes, visible changes  
Sky looking so forlorn  
It looks like the world's been born  
On one more rainy day  
  
Trying to see the sunlight  
My heart's crying out loud  
I try to see through the clouds  
On one more rainy day  
  
One more rainy day  
Once again my mind is gray  
This is what a rainy day can do  
One more rainy day  
One more rainy day  
  
Sun starts shining on through  
New day a day with you  
It's strange what sun can do  
On one more rainy day  
  
One more rainy day  
Once again my mind is gray  
This is what a rainy day can do  
One more rainy day  
One more rainy day

"Thinking out of line just to make the sun shine  
Anyway I can be like you  
Fighting with the truth  
Trying to hide a fool in a fantasy  
I'm dreaming, lay me down and take me now  
Our Lady of the skies  
  
Hiding in the sun like a loaded gun reality  
Aiming high at my dream  
But I can get along  
She makes me strong, anyway  
I'm dreaming and there is no other way  
Our Lady of the skies  
  
Flying in the sky with a bunch of high fidelity  
I can hear your song  
Offer me a ring just to show me your sincerity  
I'm dreaming, let me go  
Our Lady of the skies

"Shiny silver faces, coloured paper falling into their hand.  
Never to be seen again it must have been a one night stand.  
Up until the dawn I could have sworn that everything was alright.  
Thieving bastards stole my life and legged it off into the night.  
It's a dirty business it's a dirty game.  
Everybody different but they're all the same.  
They draw you in you hear a siren call.  
Build you up so they can see you fall.  
You've seen it all before.  
Been there since time began.  
You know what's coming next.  
Everything gets out of hand.  
They've got the lot and god knows what they think that the deserve even more.  
Psychopathic tendencies, they've got a lot of answer for.  
Scratch my back and I'll stab Yours, no wonder it's a universal sickness.  
Who are they, you well might ask, come with me and you can be my whitness.  
It's a dirty business it's a crying shame.  
You blink your eye and all the laws have changed.  
They draw you in you hear a siren call.  
Build you up so they can see you fall.  
You've seen it all before.  
Been there since time began.  
You know what's coming next.  
Everything gets out of hand.  
It's a dirty business it's crying shame.  
You blink your eye and all the laws have changed.  
They say the vulture is a bird of prey.  
No-one told me it would come this way.  
You seen it all before.  
Been there since time began.  
You know what's coming next.  
Everything, everything gets out of hand.

"I see a red door and I want it painted black,  
No colors anymore I want them to turn black.  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.  
  
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black,  
With flowers and my love, both never to come back.  
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away,  
Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day.  
  
I look inside myself and see my heart is black,  
I see my red door and I want it painted black.  
  
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts,  
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.  
  
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue,  
I could not forsee this thing happening to you.  
  
If I look hard enough into the setting sun,  
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes.  
  
I see a red door and I want it painted black,  
No colors anymore I want them to turn black.  
  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.  
  
I want to see your face painted black, black as night.  
Don't want to see the sun flyin' high in the sky.  
I want to see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah!

"Child on a painted horse  
Streams that will run their course  
Gone to a far away shore  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Days of another kind  
Frost gets a bruising vine  
Why did the carpenter die  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Sweet as a rose so fine  
Peaceful as a final time  
How old could the lion man cry  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Thoughts of a winter moon  
Warm in a distant room  
Why did I fall asleep so soon  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping

"Can you remember remember my name  
As I flow through your life  
A thousand oceans I have flown  
And cold spirits of ice  
All my life  
I am the echo of your past  
  
I am returning the echo of a point in time  
Distant faces shine  
A thousand warriors I have known  
And laughing as the spirits appear  
All your life  
Shadows of another day  
  
And if you hear me talking on the wind  
You've got to understand  
We must remain  
Perfect strangers  
  
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow  
  
A strand of silver hanging through the sky  
Touching more than you see  
The voice of ages in your mind  
Is aching with the dead of the night  
Precious life (your tears are lost in  
Falling rain)  
  
And if you hear me talking on the wind  
You've got to understand  
We must remain  
Perfect strangers

"How can I see when the light is gone out?  
How can I hear when you speak so silently?  
More than enough is never too much  
Hold out a hand I'm so out of touch  
  
Do unto me as your heart would have you do  
Words in my head can I get the message through?  
Sword in my hand can cut through the wood  
Peace in my heart can soften the mood  
  
What shall I do when they stand smiling at me?  
Look at the floor and be oh, so cool  
Oh, so cool?  
  
How shall I know when to start singing my song?  
What shall I do if they all go wrong?  
What shall I do?  
  
What shall I do when they stand laughing at me?  
Walk through the door and be oh so cool?  
  
How shall I know when to stop singing my song?  
What shall I do when it all goes wrong?

"Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream  
While the children play in the field  
Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life  
But how strong is the shield?  
Can peace be found on the carpet above ground  
Where sky is forever blue  
  
So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud  
Which may take me from you  
  
Many things a man can lose  
His self, his rights, his views  
But never his heart or his love  
So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb  
To the hill up above  
  
Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream  
While our children play in the field  
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life  
And trust in the strength of the shield  
  
So trust in you love, and Lucy of above  
And let light pass like a wheel  
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance  
Kiss the strength of the shield  
  
The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground  
And to his wish he will yield  
  
Fate will have it's word, of course  
(Think this line is wrong)  
And time will change its course  
And hold the strength of the shield

"I have often told you stories  
About the way  
I lived the life of a drifter  
Waiting for the day  
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs  
Then maybe you would say  
Come lay with me and love me  
And I would surely stay  
  
But I feel I'm growing older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
Guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.  
  
Many times I've been a traveler  
I looked for something new  
In days of old when nights were cold  
I wandered without you  
But those days I thought my eyes  
Had seen you standing near  
Though blindness is confusing  
It shows that you're not here.  
  
Now I feel I'm going older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
Guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune  
  
Yes, I can hear the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
I guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.  
  
I guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.

Dancing with strangers  
Fighting with friends  
  
It's a matter of time  
Between love and despair  
Falling over the line  
Empty hearts and icy stares  
Call me Solitaire  
  
The eyes  
In the face on the wall  
Follow me round the room  
Follow me everywhere  
A heart without an echo  
A man without a child  
Alone with all my sorrow  
Dancing with strangers  
Fighting with friends  
  
It's a matter of time between love and despair  
Falling over the line  
Empty hearts and icy stares  
Call me Solitaire

"There once was a woman  
A strange kind of woman  
The kind that gets written down in history  
Her name was Nancy  
Her face was nothing fancy  
She left a trail of happiness and misery  
  
I loved her  
Everybody loved her  
She loved everyone and gave them good return  
I tried to take her  
I even tried to break her  
She said I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn  
  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
I spent my money as I took my turn  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
Ooh I got a strange kind of woman  
  
She looked like a raver  
But I could never please her  
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far  
I couldn't get her  
But things got better, she said  
Saturday nights from now on baby you're my star  
  
She finally said she loved me  
I wed her in a hurry  
No more callers and I glowed with pride  
I'm dreaming  
I feel like screaming  
I won my woman just before she died  
  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
I spent my money as I took my turn

Strange, strange

My mother said to me  
'When you become a man you'll understand'  
But it's still a mystery

Get some decent clothes  
The only way to make it  
Dress the part'  
That gets right up my nose  
  
And I think to myself in this river of doubt  
This is something I can do without  
But strangeways is what I got  
  
The indians are coming Isaw it on tv  
They're 20,000 strong  
But they always get depleted by the cavalry  
Salvation is at hand  
It's guaranteed  
Just send a donation straight to God  
1-800 toll free  
  
And I think to myself in this academy of fear  
Where am I going what am I doing here  
But strangeways is all I got  
  
Have you seen the headlines  
Princess engaged  
3 million out of work  
But that's on the 2nd page  
The alien has landed  
Finger in his ear  
Can't hear a word I am saying  
But that ain't such a bad idea  
  
And I think to myself in this cradle of lust  
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust  
But strangeways is all you get

Running through my memory on the street of dreams  
  
There you stood, a distant memory

Said to myself, I knew you'd set me free  
And here we are right back where we started

Maybe this fantasy is real  
Now I'm gonna see what I want it to be

On the streets of dreams

Will we ever meet again, my friend, on the street of dreams?  
Do you know just what it means to be on the street of dreams?  
Never know just who you'll see, do ya? On the street of dreams  
You can be who you wanna be, oh Lord, on the street of dreams

In this breathing space

The more I stand to lose  
So I'm gonna unpack my bags  
And take off my shoes

At the big oak door

Hate's a habit, it's hard to shake the curse  
Kill to live, and live to die

Touching all the senses

The burning of a book

The Spanish archer's gonna make you pay  
  
Do you remember when the sky was blue  
we used to talk for miles  
And now we drive along in this thundering silence  
It's such an obvious lie with that easy smile of yours  
I'm letting go and I'm falling  
I'm getting out, losing ground  
The Spanish archer's gonna bring you down  
  
Well is there something I can say as we stumble to the edge have we gone too
far  
Why don't we call it a day before we call it a nightmare darlin'  
If we made a mistake then all that it takes to be free  
Is the wave of a hand and you're falling  
And as you turn, don't look away  
The Spanish archer's gonna make you pay

"You're so hot, you're so cool  
I can see that you're nobody's fool  
Now tell me am I coming through  
It's too late, I can't wait  
Believe it's gonna be a big mistake  
But I'm tempted to believe in you  
  
I don't want to run and I don't want to fight  
I just want to be the one you love tonight  
Unclose my eyes, let it be  
  
Bring on the band of angels from the great divide  
I'll never get to heaven so take me for a ride  
Fruit on the tree is shaking, my mind is in a daze  
I just want a taste of your love  
And learn your wicked ways  
  
You're so bad, it feels good  
There's so much I never understood  
Oh Mama take a look at me now  
I'm hung up, strung out  
All I want to do is scream and shout your name  
Addicted to you somehow  
  
Electric in your touch there's magic in your kiss  
You know I never knew that love could feel like this  
Unclose my eyes, set me free  
  
Bring on the band of angels from the great divide  
I'll never get to heaven so take me for a ride  
Fruit on the tree is shaking, my mind is in a daze  
I just want a taste of your love  
And learn your wicked ways

"You keep on moving  
Far away, far away  
You you keep on moving  
Far away, far away  
  
Every day  
Wheels are turning  
And the crime  
Still returning  
  
Dawn will soon be breaking, the day has just begun,  
You put your arms around me like a circle round the sun,  
You dance across the seasons,  
To a place where no one knows  
Where angels fear to tread  
  
Dawn will soon be breaking, the day has just begun,  
You put your arms around me like a circle round the sun,  
You dance across the seasons,  
To a place where no one knows  
Where angels fear to tread  
  
You keep on moving  
Far away, far away  
You you keep on moving  
Far away, far away  
  
Every day  
Wheels are turning  
And the crime  
Still returning
