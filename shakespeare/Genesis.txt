"There's nothing here that I can understand  
And no one cares I'm a lonely man  
I touch your face and I don't know why  
I call your name but you're going by  
Now I'm alone again  
  
I have no name for each and every day  
Until the year is done and fades away  
There's a time in between the two  
The old years gone but it's not the new  
And I  
  
I know that I'll be all  
Alone again, alone again tonight, oh I'm  
Alone again, alone again tonight, oh I'm  
Alone again, it seems to me that every time I try to change  
Say that you'll, say that you'll  
Help me reach the other side  
  
When the morning comes, the sun is out  
And warms me up again  
What a funny world it is for me  
And all I'll ever be  
  
It's not enough, it's not enough  
This feeling I'm feeling inside  
Oh I know it, I know tonight that I'll be  
  
On my own again, alone again tonight  
Oh I'm alone again, alone again tonight Oh I'm alone again, it  
seems to me that every time I try to change  
Say that you'll, say that you'll  
Help me reach the other side  
  
Help me please 'cause I know I'm gonna be  
On my own again, alone again tonight  
Oh I'm alone again, alone again tonight Oh I'm alone again, it  
seems to me that every time I try to change  
Say that you'll, say that you'll  
Help me reach the other side

"You know,  
You decorate the garage wall,  
Hang in people's halls,  
Live in secret drawers,  
If you could look around you,  
Wonder what you'd see.  
  
Fiction.  
That's all you really are I know,  
Editorial dreams.  
They can't make you real,  
Tell me where you came from,  
And where you're going to.  
  
I won't ever, no I'll never get to know her,  
Or be the cause of anything she does.  
I won't ever, no I'll never get to hold her.  
Do you think this aching could be love?  
  
Oh you know,  
You've figured in some fantasies.  
You would not believe,  
What you've had to do,  
Life goes on around you all because of you.  
  
I won't ever, no I'll never get to know her,  
Or be the cause of anything she does.  
I won't ever, no I'll never get to hold her.  
Do you think this aching could be love?  
  
You know,  
That in twenty years or more,  
You still look the same  
As you do today.  
You'll still be a young girl,  
When I'm old and grey.  
  
I won't ever, no I'll never get to know her,  
Or be the cause of anything she does.  
I won't ever, no I'll never get to hold her.  
Do you think this aching could be love?

"Can't you feel our souls ignite  
Shedding ever changing colours, in the darkness of the fading night,  
Like the river joins the ocean, as the germ in a seed grows  
We have finally been freed to get back home.  
  
There's an angel standing in the sun, and he's crying with a loud voice,  
""This is the supper of the mighty one"",  
Lord of Lords,  
King of Kings,  
Has returned to lead his children home,  
To take them to the new Jerusalem.

"Gimme a song I know, something I can relate to  
People never criticise the way I play  
Show me the way to go, I need to make a breakthrough  
I dont think that I can wait another day  
  
Its putting years on me, Im a young man going grey  
I dont believe that I can wait another day  
  
This simple melody is all I have  
I make my living that way  
I make good friends that way  
Ooh, I really can make no sense of it, as hard as I try  
Is it something I do wrong please wont you tell me why  
People all seem to like it and no one knows about it more than i  
  
I met a man today who walked in my direction  
Stopped took off his hat and lit a cigarette  
He listened carefully to what I had been playing  
He threw a coin into my hat and walked away  
  
Always play just what they want me to  
Everybody wants the same song  
If only I could do it in my own way  
I feel such emotion, emotion, ooh, emotion, emotion, ooh  
  
Say gimme a song I know, something I can relate to  
And no one wants to criticise the way I play  
I should just say no and play them what I want to  
Cos I dont think that I can wait another day  
  
Its putting years on me, Im a young man going grey  
I dont believe that I can wait another day  
  
This simple melody is all I have  
I make my living that way  
I make good friends that way  
They feel my emotion, emotion, ooh, ooh  
Emotion, emotion, ooh

"Get out of the way fat man. You got something to do  
Go fill up your hands till they're shining up at you.  
You gotta get out while there's gold in the air  
It's falling like water, coming down from the hills.  
Go West young man  
Earn a dollar a day just like your family said.  
You're rolling your days right on into the night  
The head of the line's going way out of sight.  
Go West young man like your family said  
All along the wagons  
All along the dusty trail.  
Seventeen years not over a day  
Like children in the wild.  
Your mother's milk still wet on your face  
And no one to pray for your safe journey home.  
Out beyond the desert  
Across the mountains by the fall.  
Servants who leave their masters house  
Are walking all the way.  
The golden fields that beckoned you  
Are darkened by the years.  
Go West Young Man  
If you knew then what you know today  
You'd be back where you started a happier man  
And leave all the glory to those who have remained.  
So Go West Young Man  
Go West Young Man, like your family said.

"Too big to fly, dodo ugly so dodo must die,  
Doggo with fear on its side, can't change, can't change the tide.  
Dog baiter, agitator, keeps asking questions, says he wants to know why.  
Ain't no reason that money can't buy.  
Mink he pretty so mink he must die, must die, must die.  
  
Sun he giving life in his light,  
Part of the system,  
Friend to man, friend to the trees,  
No friend to the snowman.  
Where does he go, what does he do?  
Does he meet with the mole, the stream, the cloud  
And end up at the bottom of the sea.  
  
Fish he got a hook in his throat,  
Fish he got problems  
Where does he go, what does he do?  
Does he hope he's too small, to poor a haul,  
Who'll end up being thrown back in the sea.  
I'm back in the sea.  
  
Caretaker, horror movie,  
Only one eye, only needs one boot,  
Sweet lady, she knows she looks good  
Vacuum coming for the bright and the brute.  
  
Big noise, black smoke  
So pig-headed couldn't see the joke.  
But it ain't funny  
Ask the fly on the wall  
It's only living  
It don't matter at all, at all, at all.  
  
Pimp, he make you drool and grunt,  
He got an answer.  
One he got a dream of love,  
Deep as the ocean.  
  
Where does he go?  
What does he do?  
Will the siren team with Davy Jones,  
And trap him at the bottom of the sea?  
  
I'm back in the sea.  
I'm back in the sea.  
I'm back in the sea.

"The grey of evening  
Fills the room  
No need to look outside  
To see or feel the rain  
I reach across to touch her  
But I know that she's not there  
Rain keeps running down the window pane  
Time keeps running out for me  
  
Can't you see what you are doing to me  
Can't you see what you have done  
As I try to pass another long and sleepless night  
As a hundred crazy voices call my name  
As I try to pass them by  
I almost can believe that she is here  
Here in the glow of the night  
  
Do you know what you have done  
Do you know what you've begun  
Do you see we shall never be together again  
All of my life  
  
All the lonely people, empty rooms  
And all the pointless violence, silent tombs  
Could it be that we shall be together again  
  
Sheets of double glazing  
Help to keep outside the night  
Only foreign city sirens can cut through  
Nylon sheets and blankets  
Help to minimize the cold  
But they can't keep out the chilling sounds  
Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming  
That she is here with me  
Here in the glow of the night  
  
Do you know what you have done  
Do you know what you've begun  
Do you see we shall never be together again  
All of my life  
  
All the lonely people, empty rooms  
And all the pointless violence, silent tombs  
Could it be that we shall be together again

"See my hand is moving  
Touching all that's real  
And once it stroke the love's body  
Now it claws the past  
  
The scent of a flower,  
The colors of the morning,  
Friends to believe in,  
Tears soon forgotten,  
See how the rain drives away, another day  
  
If a leaf has fallen  
Does the tree lie broken?  
And if we draw some water  
Does the well run dry?  
  
The sigh of a mother,  
The screaming of lovers,  
Like two angry tigers,  
They tear at each other  
See how for him lifetime's fears disappear  
  
Once a Jesus suffered,  
Heaven could not see him.  
And now my ship is sinking,  
The captain stands alone.  
  
A pawn on the chessboard,  
A false move by God will now destroy me,  
But wait, on the horizon,  
A new dawn seems to be rising,  
Never to recall this passerby, born to die.

"
"No cloud, a sleepy calm  
Sun baked earth that's cooled by gentle breeze  
And trees with rustling leaves  
Only endless days without a care  
Nothing must be done  
  
Silent as a day can be  
Far off sounds of others on their chosen run  
As they do all those things they feel give life some meaning  
Even if they're dull  
  
Time to stop this dreaming, must rejoin the real world  
As revealed by orange lights and a smoky atmosphere  
  
The trees and I are shaken by the same winds but whereas  
The trees will lose their withered leaves  
I just can't seem to let them loose  
And they can't refresh me those hot winds of the south  
Feel like an alien, a stranger in an alien place  
  
Now the light id fading fast  
Chances slip away, a time will come to pass  
When there'll be none  
Then addicted to a perfumed poison  
Betrayed by its aftertaste  
We shall lose the wonder and find nothing in return  
Many are the substitutes but they're powerless an their own  
  
Beware the fisherman who's casting out his line  
Into a dried up river bed  
But don't try to tell him 'cause he won't believe you  
Throw some bread to the ducks instead, it's easier that way  
Feel like an alien, a stranger in an alien place

"Talking makes us human that's what I was told  
So why do I find it so difficult to let my feelings unfold  
Had I the courage to tell you I'd promise you this  
  
If that's what you need  
I'll be the river I'll be the mountain always beside you  
If that's what you need  
I will be stronger I will be braver than ever before  
  
When you came along and turned it all around  
I promised myself I wouldn't tell you  
Until we stood on solid ground  
Holding the candle between us I'll tell you this  
  
If that's what you need  
I'll be the river I'll be the mountain always beside you  
If that's what you need  
I will be stronger I will be braver than ever before  
  
And if there's any kind of danger  
I hear you calling out my name  
You can follow in my footsteps  
And I will lead you safely back again  
  
I never understood you however hard I tried  
But it took me a while until I realized  
That all the problems were mine  
Holding you nearer to me to tell you this  
  
If that's what you need  
I'll be the river I'll be the mountain always beside you  
If that's what you need  
I will be stronger I will be braver than ever before  
And when things go wrong  
I'll be your conscience there to remind you all of your life  
When you go wrong  
I'll be the reason you'll be protected all of your days

"Got out of bed, wasn't feeling too good  
With my wallet and my passport, a new pair of shoes  
The sun is shining so I head for the park,  
With a bottle of Tequila, and a new pack of cigarettes  
  
I got a cousin and she got a friend,  
Who thought that her aunt knew a man who could help  
At his apartment I knocked on the door,  
He wouldn't come out until he got paid.  
Now don't tell anybody what I wanna do  
If they find out you know that they'll never let me through.  
  
It's no fun being an illegal alien  
It's no fun being an illegal alien  
  
Down at the office had to fill out the forms  
A pink one, a red one, the colours you choose,  
Up to the counter to see what they think  
They said 'It doesn't count man, it ain't written in ink'.  
Don't trust anybody least not around here, cause  
  
It's not fun being an illegal alien,  
It's not fun being an illegal alien,  
It's not fun being an illegal alien,  
It's not fun being an illegal alien,  
An illegal alien, O.K.  
  
Consideration for your fellow man  
Wouldn't hurt anybody, sure fits in with my plan  
Over the border, there lies the promised land  
  
So don't tell anybody what I wanna do  
If they find out you know that they'll never let me through.  
  
It's no fun being an illegal alien,  
It's no fun being an illegal alien,  
It's no fun being an illegal alien,  
It's no fun being an illegal alien.

"People moving about the town upside down, you know why  
Little bits of coloured glass in the sky  
Children pushing mummy down to the park, in a pram  
Look out the pavement's changing to jam  
See them running  
Now where are they going to  
To follow them, leads you nowhere  
Shout to them quickly but no one can hear you  
All they can do is to stare  
Your bowler hats are turning green  
Your city suits are coloured cream  
You, you who changed my life  
You made it misery, sadness reins alone  
Wonder why you do this, to me  
When I've tried so hard for you  
People talking to the man who's digging a hole, in his mind  
He's no need to worry, he's deaf and blind  
See the dustman doing his round in a rolls made of glass  
He's gained everything because he's got class  
Friends are leaving me when I did everything  
Just as they used to behave  
Trying to copy them, losing my real self  
Floating away in a cloud  
Your minds have blown you out of step  
The rules you taught you never kept  
You, you who changed my life

I stand upon the mountain  
A million miles from my home  
And the faces of fear  
I have freedom to think  
In hiding  
I may take off my clothes  
That I wear on my face  
I float upon a river  
A million miles from the plains  
That are piercing the clouds  
I am lost in the beauty  
In hiding  
Pick me up, put me down  
Push me in, turn me round  
Switch me on, let me go

I walk among the tall trees  
This is beauty I know  
I am in love with it all

In the cold, feel the cold  
All around

Surrounds me with its sound.  
  
Striking out to reach you  
I can't get through to the other side,  
When you're racing in the rapids  
There's only one way, that's to ride.  
  
Taken down, taken down  
By the undertow  
I'm spiralled down the river bed,  
My fire is burning low.  
Catching hold of a rock that's firm,  
I'm waiting for John to be carried past.  
We hold together, hold together  
And shoot the rapids fast.  
  
And when the waters slow down  
The dark and the deep have no-one, no-one, no-one, no-one, no-one left to
keep.  
Hang on John! We're out of this at last.

I should know  
  
Well papa he said you must walk up the hill  
Oh papa he said if you don't someone else will  
Papa he said if youve done everything I've told you to  
And I've never had the feeling in the past  
And I've never felt I needed to impress  
  
Well papa he said you must turn the lights down low  
Oh papa he said that way no one will ever know  
Papa he said if you follow him wherever he may go, don't say no  
  
Oh papa he said you must walk up the hill  
Papa he said if you don't no one else will  
No one else will  
Turn the lights down low  
No one will know  
Turn the lights down low  
The lights down low...

"No not this confused again  
No not the same mistakes again.  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard  
  
Why can't you see what's going on?  
I know you'd never admit  
You would ever be to blame  
Everything's a game to you  
The old days are gone  
And they're better left alone  
I cannot help you, it's much too late  
  
No not this confused again  
No not the same mistakes again.  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard  
  
There's always a reason why it happened  
You never never did anything wrong, but it  
It just happened to fall apart  
You're taking it all too hard  
  
Now that it's dark, all of your fears,  
Like shadows creeping around.  
You're much too scared to look down  
And it's lonely out on your own  
  
The old days are gone  
And they're better left alone  
But I still miss you  
I keep it to myself  
  
Oh no not this confused again  
Oh no not the same mistakes again  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard  
  
Oh no not this confused again  
Oh no not the same mistakes again  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard  
You're taking it all to heart  
You're taking it all too hard

"Mothers crying in the street  
Children dying at their feet, tell me why  
People starving everywhere  
There's too much food but none to spare, tell me why  
  
Can you see that shaft of sunlight  
Can you see it in my eyes  
I can feel the fire that's burning  
Anger and hope so deep  
So deep within my heart  
Before my eyes  
For some it's too late  
It seems there's no-one listening  
  
People sleeping in the streets  
No roof above, no food to eat, tell me why  
See the questions in their eyes  
Listen to their children's cries, tell me why  
  
If there's a God  
Is he watching  
Can he give a ray of hope  
So much pain and so much sorrow  
Tell me what does he see  
When he looks at you  
When he looks at me  
What would he say  
It seems there's no-one listening  
  
Who would think it still could happen  
Even in this time and place  
Politicians, they may save themselves  
But they won't save their face  
Just hope against hope  
It's not too late  
  
You say there's nothing you can do  
Is there one rule for them and one for you  
Tell me why  
  
Listen can you see that shaft of sunlight  
Can you see it in my eyes  
I can feel the fire that's burning  
Anger and hope so deep  
So deep within my heart  
Before my eyes  
For some it's too late  
It seems there's no-one listening  
  
Hurry for me, hurry for me, they cry

"Just as I thought it was going alright  
I find out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right  
S'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all  
I could say day, you'd say night  
Tell it's black when I know that it's white  
S'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all  
  
I could leave but I won't go  
Though my heart might tell me so  
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes  
So why does it always seem to be  
Me looking at you, you looking at me  
S'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all  
  
Turning me on, turning me off  
Making me feel like I want too much  
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time  
Running around, staying out all night  
Taking it all instead of taking one bite  
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time  
  
I could leave but I won't go  
It'd be easier I know  
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes  
But why does it always seem to be  
Me looking at you, you looking at me  
S'always the same, just a shame, that's all  
  
Truth is I love you  
More than I wanted to  
There's no point in trying to pretend  
There's been no-one who  
Makes me feel like you do  
Say we'll be together til the end  
  
I could leave but I won't go  
It'd be easier I know  
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes  
But why does it always seem to be  
Me looking at you, you looking at me  
S'always the same, just a shame, that's all  
  
Just as I thought it was going alright  
I find out I'm wrong when I thought I was right  
S'always the same, just a shame, that's all  
I could say day, you'd say night  
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white  
S'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all  
  
That's all

"I know a farmer who looks after the farm.  
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest.  
I know a fireman who looks after the fire.  
You, can't you see he's fooled you all.  
Yes, he's here again, can't you see he's fooled you all.  
Share his peace,  
Sign the lease.  
He's a supersonic scientist,  
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man.  
Look, look into my mouth he cries,  
And all the children lost down many paths,  
I bet my life you'll walk inside  
Hand in hand,  
Gland in gland  
With a spoonful of miracle,  
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man.  
We will rock you, rock you little snake,  
We will keep you snug and warm.

"And the lamb lies down on Broadway.  
  
Early morning Manhattan,  
Ocean winds blow on the land.  
The Movie-Palace is now undone,  
The all-night watchmen have had their fun.  
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,  
It's the same old ending-time to go.  
Get out!  
It seems they cannot leave their dream.  
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam,  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.  
  
Nightime's flyers feel their pains.  
Drugstore takes down the chains.  
Metal motion comes in bursts,  
But the gas station can quench that thirst.  
Suspension cracked on unmade road  
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'  
And out on the subway,  
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid  
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.  
  
The lamb seems right out of place,  
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face.  
Somehow it's lying there,  
Brings a stillness to the air.  
Though man-made light, at night is very bright,  
There's no whitewash victim,  
As the neons dim, to the coat of white.  
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid,  
Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did,  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.  
  
Suzanne tired her work all done,  
Thinks money-honey-be on-neon.  
Cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn  
And the sawdust king spits out his scorn.  
Wonder women draw your blind!  
Don't look at me! I'm not your kind.  
I'm Rael!  
Something inside me has just begun,  
Lord knows what I have done,  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.  
On Broadway-  
They say the lights are always bright on Broadway.  
They say there's always magic in the air.

"You're no longer part of my life  
I must remind myself again  
Too much has happened to us to cause eachother pain  
It's over now, there's too much guilt to share  
Once there would have been a time for talking and learning  
  
There must be some other way  
To get where we have to go  
There must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
Once it would have been so easy, to do what we have to do  
There must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
  
Are we no more than parts in a play  
Letting other people, strangers say our lines?  
To think it should come to this, after all these years  
What was mine and what should stay behind  
Once there would have been a time of sharing, of caring  
  
There must be some other way  
To get where we have to go  
There must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
Once it would have been so easy to do what we have to do  
(there must be some other way)  
There must be some other way  
Please show me, show me another way  
  
There's nothing much left to say  
We have said it once and said it all again  
This time we have gone too far, it could never be the same  
It's time to carry on create new lives  
Once we promised we would stay together forever  
  
There must be some other way  
To get where we have to go (there must be some other way)  
There must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
Once it would have been so easy to do what we have to do (what we have to do)  
You know there must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
You know there must be another way  
Please show me, show me another way (there must be some other way)  
You know there must be some other way

"Standing in a forest gazing at the sun  
Looking at the trees but there's not even one  
See a rippling stream that smiles and then goes by  
Run to feel its comfort but the water's dry.  
  
I see her face and run to take her hand  
Why she's never there I just don't understand  
The trumpets sound my whole world crumbles down  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky.  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye.  
  
As the leaves will crumble so will fall my love  
For the fragile beauty of our lives must fade  
Though I once remember echoes of my youth  
Now I sense no past, no love that ends in love  
  
Take this dream the stars have filled with light  
As the blossom glides like snowflakes from the trees  
In vengeance to a god no-one can reach  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky.  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye.  
  
Ice is moving and the world's begun to freeze  
See the sunlight stopped and deadned by the breeze  
Minds are empty bodies more insensitive  
Some believe that when they die they really live  
  
I believe there never is an end  
God gave up the world its people long ago  
Why she's never there I still don't understand  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky.  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye.

"Crossing the mountains of truth see them  
Shadows of night disappear  
Rise from the slough of despond, find the pathway  
Guiding us forward through pastures of dream day  
Days to enjoy, peace I knew once before me  
Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning  
Come see me take my hand  
Come see me in my land  
Flying invisibly high, watch me  
All on a beautiful sky, I'll be  
Clear and serene in the love I've discovered  
Long search is over, the soul is uncovered  
Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing  
Bidding farewell to the fears now decreased  
Come see me take my hand  
Come see me in my land  
High on a golden crested wave she sits  
The little nymphs dance in her hair  
The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives  
Horizons come to sip wine there  
The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef  
The albatross flies to the stern  
And only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return  
Crossing the mountains of truth see them  
Soaring majestically high, and then  
Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly  
Thunder awakes me, it crashes beside me  
Shatter the scene and bring chaos to beauty  
Leading me forward where destiny may be  
Come see me take my hand  
View from another land
