"Well you and I  
We're buddies  
And we've been since we first met  
Me any you  
Well we've sure been through  
Our share of laughter and regret  
Lord knows we've had our bad days  
And more than once we've disagreed  
But you've always been a friend to me  
You can be so stubborn  
There's times I think you just like to fight  
And I hope and pray  
I live to see a day  
When you say I might be right  
And there's times I'd rather kill you  
Than listen to your honesty  
But you've always been a friend to me  
You've always been  
Time and again  
The one to take my hand  
And show to me it's okay to be  
Just the way I am  
With no apology  
Oh you've always been  
And you will 'till God knows when  
Yes you've always been a friend to me

"
"Twenty-five minutes past quitting time  
Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine  
Paying no attention to them highway signs  
Doing ninety miles an hour toward the county line  
Quick sack, twelve pack, back again  
It's a B double E double, are you N.  
  
My buddies and their babies letting down their hair  
As long as we're together it don't matter where  
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care  
Knowing half the fun is getting there  
Aztec, long-necks, paychecks spent  
oh, it's a B double E double, are you N.  
  
I can't stop thinking  
What the hell they were drinking  
When they made this county dry  
I got a week long thirst  
And to make it worse  
Lord, it's my turn to drive  
  
Laughing and a bragging and a carrying on  
We loaded up the wagons and we headed home  
I guess a half a dozen cases doesn't last that long  
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone  
Then, it's turn around, leave town, sounds again  
Like a B double E double, are you N.

"Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and far away  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
The shepherds all were watching  
Over their sheep at night  
When a guiding star shone from heaven  
And the followed that holy light  
  
Got tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
They found a lovely manger  
Where the humble Christ was born  
And God sent out salvation  
On that blessed Christmas morn  
  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
He brought with Him forgiveness  
He live to show us the way  
He came to redeem all creation  
And to wash all our sins away  
  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born

Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again  
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me  
You know she won't understand

"A little baby told God,  
'Hey, I'm kinda scared,  
Don't really know if I wanna go down there,  
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball  
But that's a great big place, and I'm so small.  
  
Why can't I just stay here with you?  
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too? '  
And God said, 'Oh child, of course I do,  
But there's somebody special that's waiting for you  
  
So hush now, baby, don't you cry  
Because there's someone down there waiting  
Whose only goal in life  
Is making sure you're always gonna be all right  
A loving angel, tender, tough, and strong  
Come on, child, it's time to meet your mom  
  
Now, when she's talking to you  
Make sure you listen close  
Because she's gonna teach you everything  
You'll ever need to know  
  
Like how to mind your manners  
To love and laugh and dream  
And she'll put you on the path  
That'll bring you back to me  
  
So hush now, little baby, don't you cry  
Because there's someone down there waiting  
Whose only goal in life  
Is making sure you're always gonna be all right  
A loving angel, tender, tough, and strong  
Come on, child, it's time to meet your mom

"Our guardian star lost all it's glow  
The day that I lost you  
It lost all its glitter the day you said no  
And its grey stars turned to blue  
Like him I am doubtful that your love is true  
So if you decide to call on me  
Ask for Mr. Blue  
I'm Mr. Blue  
When you say you love me  
Then prove it by going out on the sly  
Provin' your love is untrue  
Call me Mr. Blue  
I sleep alone each night  
Wait by the phone each night  
But you don't call  
And I won't hurt my pride  
Call me mister  
I won't tell you  
When you paint the town  
A bright red to turn it upside down  
I'm painting it too  
But I'm painting it blue  
I sleep alone each night  
Wait by the phone each night  
But you don't call  
And I won't hurt my pride  
Call me mister  
I won't tell you  
When you paint the town  
A bright red to turn it upside down  
I'm painting it too  
But I'm painting it blue  
Call me Mr. Blue  
Call me mister

"[Chorus]  
Please operator could you trace this call  
Find out where I'm drinking  
Which dirty beer hall  
And send a cab driver to call for me here  
No need to describe me  
'Cause I ain't all here  
  
She told me to get lost  
And that's what I did  
But I've done it so well  
I don't know where I hid  
And she swore that she never will see me again  
Hell I'll never find me  
In the shape that I'm in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I had to ask myself  
If I were me  
And I was out drinking  
Well where would I be  
Then I thumb nailed the label  
And there I appeared  
Hiding out in a bottle  
Behind a three-day old beard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I may be lonely  
But I'm never alone  
Cause I've been beside myself  
Since she's been gone  
  
Oh, please operator could you trace this call  
Find out where I'm drinking  
Which dirty beer hall  
And send a cab driver to call for me here  
And if he can find me  
I'll buy him a beer  
  
Please operator could you trace this call  
Find out where I'm drinking  
Which filthy beer hall  
And send a cab driver to call for me here  
I'll be beside myself  
Pouring down beer

"While they dance  
How she holds him  
Pulls him close  
And loves him so  
While he dreams of another  
And counts the days  
Until he lets her go  
  
Same old story  
That everybody knows  
It's one heart holdin' on  
One letting go  
  
While they ride  
Lord he tells her  
How they two  
Will settle down  
But she only hears the highway  
And a voice  
In some other town  
  
And the harder  
He holds her  
The more she slips away  
  
Same old story  
That everybody knows  
It's one heart holdin' on  
One letting go  
Same old story

"Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy  
Or daddy looked a lot like him  
It's not the way I had him pictured  
Santa was much too thin  
  
[Chorus]  
He didn't come down the chimney  
So mama must have let him in  
Santa looked a lot like daddy  
Or daddy looked a lot like him  
  
Well, they thought I was fast-a-sleppin'  
They thought that I was tucked in his bed  
They never thought I'd come a-peepin'  
Or that I'd hear what was said  
  
Santa put his arm around mama  
And mama put her arm around him  
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy  
Well then I'm a gonna tell on them  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never saw Dancer or Prancer  
I never heard the sleigh bells ring  
I never saw a red-nosed reindeer  
Like they show on the TV screen  
  
But he sure brought lots of presents  
So Santa Claus he must have been  
Well he sure looked a lot like daddy  
Or daddy looked a lot like him

"It was a hundred and seven  
We were heading to town  
She had her sleeves rolled up  
And the windows rolled down  
That girl is a cowboy  
Robert Earl was singing out  
The ""Buckin' Song""  
With every word that Keen was bringing  
She was singing along  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
(chorus)  
Sometimes the best cowboys  
Ain't cowboys at all  
She's got my back  
Even when it's against the wall  
When I need a friend  
She's the guy I call  
'Cause sometimes the best cowboys  
Ain't cowboys at all  
  
So I took her out to show her  
How to rope and ride  
I can't believe that it was me  
That wound up broke and tied  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
So that night I decided  
We should paint the town  
I made it home although  
I really don't remember how  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
There's just something that a cowgirl has  
Ain't no cowboys got  
Man she's something when she's one of the boys  
But something else  
Any time she's not  
  
(Repeat Chorus)

"She dropped her boy at school on time  
One less worry on her mind  
Now it's off to work and on the radio  
Come's an old familiar song  
And then the D.J.'s voice comes on  
And say's he's back in town tonight for one last show.  
  
Her eyes well up with tears  
God could it be it's been ten years  
Since that Autumn night outside the county fair  
When two strangers shared a night  
And in the darkness found a light  
That to this day is still alive and burning there.  
  
He asked her twice to come along  
They said good-bye at the break of dawn  
'Cause you can't hold back the wind  
If it's meant to be again  
Then someday he'll find his way back to her arms.  
  
The marquee misspelled his name  
And not too many people came  
But that didn't matter to them  
They laughed and loved all through the night  
And as they faced the morning light  
They found themselves standing there again.  
  
And he asked her twice to come along  
They said good-bye at the break of dawn  
As his bus left out she cried  
With him standing by her side  
That ol' wind had once again found it's way home.  
Someday he'll tell her about the money he hid  
And someday she'll tell him that the boy is his kid.  
But for right now they're both in love  
The only thing they're thinkin' of  
Is that they're finally where their hearts have always been.

"I went to work for her that summer  
A teenage kid so far from home  
She was a lonely widow woman  
Hell bent to make it on her own  
We were a thousand miles from nowhere  
Wheat fields as far as I could see  
Both needing something from each other  
Not knowing yet what that might be  
'Til she came to me one evening  
Hot cup of coffee and a smile  
In a dress that I was certain  
  
She hadn't worn in quite a while  
There was a difference in her laughter  
There was a softness in her eyes  
And on the air there was a hunger  
Even a boy could recognize  
She had a need to feel the thunder  
To chase the lightning from the sky  
To watch a storm with all its wonder  
Raging in her lover's eyes  
She had to ride the heat of passion  
Like a comet burning bright  
  
Rushing headlong in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burning both ends of the night  
That summer wind was all around me  
Nothing between us but the night  
When I told her that I'd never  
She softly whispered ""That's alright""  
And then I watched her hands of leather  
Turn to velvet in a touch  
There's never been another summer  
When I have ever learned so much  
  
She had a need to feel the thunder  
To chase the lightning from the sky  
To watch a storm with all its wonder  
Raging in her lover's eyes  
She had to ride the heat of passion  
Like a comet burning bright  
Rushing headlong in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burning both ends of the night  
I often think about that summer  
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace  
  
And I have rarely held another  
When I haven't seen her face  
And every time I pass a wheat field  
And watch it dancing with the wind  
Although I know it isn't real  
I swear inside I feel  
Her hungry arms again  
She had a need to feel the thunder  
To chase the lightning from the sky  
To watch a storm with all its wonder  
  
Raging in her lover's eyes  
She had to ride the heat of passion  
Like a comet burning bright  
Rushing headlong in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burning both ends of the night  
Rushing in long in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burnin' both ends of the night

"They packed up all his buckles and shipped his saddle to his dad  
And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad  
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall  
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call  
  
He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride  
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied  
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand  
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne  
  
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name  
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim  
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand  
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne  
  
They never found her body, just her diary by the bed  
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said  
When he told her he was ridin' she said, 'Then I don't give a damn  
If you never come back from Cheyenne?  
  
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name  
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim  
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand  
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne  
  
Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive  
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night  
And if you go down by the water, you'll see her footprints in the sand  
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne  
  
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

"One hand reaches out  
And pulls a lost soul from harm  
While a thousand more go unspoken for  
And they say,  
""What good have you done by saving just this one""  
""It's like whispering a prayer  
In the fury of a storm""  
  
And I hear them saying,  
""You'll never change things.  
And no matter what you do  
It's still the same thing""  
But it's not the world that I am changing  
I do this so, this world will know  
That it will not change me  
  
This heart still believes  
That love and mercy still exist  
While all the hatreds rage  
And so many say  
""That love is all but pointless,  
in madness such as this.""  
""It's like trying to stop a fire  
with the moisture of a kiss.""  
  
And I hear them saying,  
""You'll never change things.  
And no matter what you do  
It's still the same thing""  
But it's not the world that I am changing  
I do this so, this world will know  
That it will not change me  
  
As long long as one heart still holds on  
Then hope is never really gone  
  
And I hear them saying,  
""You'll never change things.  
And no matter what you do  
It's still the same thing""  
But it's not the world that I am changing  
I do this so, this world we know  
That it will not change me  
  
What I do is so, this world will know  
That it will not change me

"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering you a simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Though it's been said many times many ways  
Merry Christmas to you

"Looking back on the memory of  
The dance we shared beneath the stars above  
For a moment all the world was right  
How could I have known you'd ever say goodbye  
And now I'm glad I didn't know  
The way it all would end the way it all would go  
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain  
But I'd have to miss the dance  
Holding you I held everything  
For a moment wasn't I the king  
But if I'd only known how the king would fall  
Hey who's to say you know I might have changed it all  
And now I'm glad I didn't know  
The way it all would end the way it all would go  
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain  
But I'd of had to miss the dance  
Yes my life is better left to chance  
I could have missed the pain but I'd of had to miss the dance

"Well it took a little time  
But I guess you finally learned  
That promises get broken  
And bridges do get burned  
You've been siftin' through the ashes  
Just tryin' to find a flame  
Holdin' on to nothin'  
You're a victim of the game  
  
You were standin' way too close  
To see it all fall apart  
And there were things you couldn't hear  
'Cause you were listenin' with your heart  
But you can't say I didn't warn you  
Now there's no one else to blame  
There's on one quite as blind  
As a victim of the game  
  
And it don't matter who you are  
It treats everyone the same  
All you need's a heart  
To be a victim of the game  
  
You know it's really gettin' to you  
When you take to tellin' lies  
And you can try to fool your friends  
But you can't look 'em in the eye  
There ain't no standin' tall  
In the shadow of the shame  
When everybody knows  
That you're a victim of the game  
  
And it don't matter who you are  
It treats everyone the same  
All you need's a heart  
To be a victim of the game  
  
Oh you know when I look into your eyes  
I can really feel the pain  
Starin' in the mirror  
At a victim of the game

Baby, completely wrapped up in you

Every now and then when the world  
That we're living in is crazy  
You gladly hold me and carry me through  
No one in the world has ever done  
What you do for me and I'd be  
Sad and lonely if there were no you  
  
How do I love you, well count the ways  
There ain't a number high enough to end this phrase  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you

How do I love you, well, don't you know  
I love you about as deep as any love can grow  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you
