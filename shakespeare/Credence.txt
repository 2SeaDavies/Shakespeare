"I see a bad moon rising.  
I see trouble on the way.  
I see earthquakes and lightnin'.  
I see bad times today.  
  
Don't go around tonight,  
Well it's bound to take your life,  
There's a bad moon on the rise.  
  
I hear hurricanes a blowing.  
I know the end is coming soon.  
I fear rivers over flowing.  
I hear the voice of rage and ruin.  
  
Well don't go around tonight,  
Well it's bound to take your life,  
There's a bad moon on the rise.  
  
Hope you got your things together.  
Hope you are quite prepared to die.  
Looks like we're in for nasty weather.  
One eye is taken for an eye.  
  
Well don't go around tonight,  
Well it's bound to take your life,  
There's a bad moon on the rise.  
  
Don't come around tonight,  
Well it's bound to take your life,  
There's a bad moon on the rise.

"Now when I was just a little boy standin' to my Daddy's knee  
My Poppa said son don't let the man get you do what he done to me  
'Cause he'll get you 'cause he'll get you now now.  
  
I can remember the fourth of July runnin' through the backwood bare.  
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin' chasin' down a hoodoo there  
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.  
  
[Chorus]  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou.  
  
Wish I was back on the bayou rollin' with some Cajun Queen.  
Wishin' I were a freight train, oh, just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can remember the fourth of July, runnin' through the backwood bare.  
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin', chasin' down a hoodoo there,  
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.  
  
[Chorus]

"
"You passed me by one sunny day  
Flashed those big brown eyes my way  
And oh I wanted you forever more  
Now I'm not one that gets around  
I swear my feet stuck to the ground  
And though I never did meet you before  
  
[Chorus]  
I said ""Hello Mary Lou  
Goodbye heart  
Sweet Mary Lou  
I'm so in love with you  
I knew Mary Lou  
We'd never part  
So Hello Mary Lou  
Goodbye heart""  
  
I saw your lips I heard your voice  
believe me I just had no choice  
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away  
I thought about a moonlit night  
My arms about good an' tight  
That's all I had to see for me to say  
  
[Chorus]

"
"I bet you're wonderin' how I knew  
'Bout your plans to make me blue  
With some other guy you knew before  
Between the two of us guys  
You know I loved you more  
It took me by surprise I must say  
When I found out yesterday  
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind  
  
Honey, honey yeah.  
I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine baby  
  
I know a man ain't supposed to cry  
But these tears I can't hold inside  
Losin' you would end my life you see  
'Cause you mean that much to me  
You could have told me yourself  
That you loved some one else  
Instead I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine  
And I'm just about to lose my mind  
  
Honey, honey yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine, baby  
  
People say believe half of what you see  
Son and none of what you hear  
But I can't help but be confused  
If it's true please tell me dear  
Do you plan to let me go  
For the other guy you loved before?  
  
Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine  
I'm just about to love my mind  
Honey, honey, yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine,  
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah

Maybe you don't understand it.  
But if you're a natural man,  
You got to ball and have a good time  
And that's what I call chooglin'.

"Just got home from Illinois locked the front door oh boy!  
Got to sit down take a rest on the porch  
Imagination sets in pretty soon I'm singin'  
  
Doo doo doo lookin' out my back door  
  
There's a giant doing cartwheels a statue wearin' high heels  
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn  
A dinosaur Victrola list'ning to Buck Owens  
  
Doo doo doo lookin' out my back door  
  
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band  
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon?  
Doo, doo doo  
Wond'rous apparition provided by magician  
  
Doo doo doo lookin' out my back door  
  
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band  
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon?  
Doo, doo doo  
Bother me tomorrow, today, I'll buy no sorrow  
  
Doo doo doo lookin' out my back door

Messin' with the sheriff  
Drivin' in a blue car  
She don't see no red light

She's comin' in the mornin'  
Lookin' a disaster  
Drivin' in the prowl car  
Spent the night in jail

Drivin' to the state house  
If she makes a million  
Papa can retire

"Left a good job in the city  
Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day  
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'  
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been  
  
Big wheel keep on turnin'  
Proud Mary keep on burnin'  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river  
  
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis  
Pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans  
But I never saw the good side of the city  
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen  
  
Big wheel keep on turnin'  
Proud Mary keep on burnin'  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river  
  
If you come down to the river  
Bet you gonna find some people who live  
You don't have to worry 'cause you have [if you got] no money  
People on the river are happy to give  
  
Big wheel keep on turnin'  
Proud Mary keep on burnin'  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river  
  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Move,  
Down the road  
I go.

There's mud in the water,  
Roach in the cellar,  
Bugs in the sugar,  
Mortgage on the home,  
Mortgage on the home.  
  
There's garbage on the sidewalk,  
Highways in the back yard,  
Police on the corner,  
Mortgage on the car,  
  
Mortgage on the car.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They're selling independence,  
Actors in the white house,  
Acid in digestion,  
Mortgage on my life,  
Mortgage on my life.

"Woke up early feelin' light, (shame, it's a shame.)  
Somebody got to me last night, (shame, it's a shame.)
