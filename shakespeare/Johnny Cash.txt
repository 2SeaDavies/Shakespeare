"Well they're building a gallows outside my cell I've got 25 minutes to go  
And the whole town's waitin' just to hear me yell I've got 24 minutes to go  
Well they gave me some beans for my last meal I've got 23 minutes to go  
But nobody asked me how I feel I've got 22 minutes to go  
Well I sent for the governor and the whole dern bunch with 21 minutes to go  
And I sent for the mayor but he's out to lunch I've got 20 more minutes to go  
Then the sheriff said boy I gonna watch you die got 19 minutes to go  
So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye got 18 minutes to go

But this is for real so forget about me got 8 more minutes to go  
With my feet on the trap and my head on the noose got 5 more minutes to go  
Won't somebody come and cut me loose with 4 more minutes to go

"I want you to uh, I want to a,  
If you don't mind Carl, I'd like you to stay out and help us on some songs  
I'd love to  
One of the greatest guitar players as well as song writers and singers in
Memphis  
Appreciate a little help on guitar, alright. Thank you Carl  
  
Well,my daddy left home when I was three  
And he didn't leave much to ma and me  
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze  
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid  
But the meanest thing that he ever did  
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue  
  
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke  
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk  
It seems I had to fight my whole life through  
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red  
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,  
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue  
  
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean  
My fist got hard and my wits got keen  
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame  
But I made a vow to the moon and stars  
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars  
And kill that man who gave me that awful name  
  
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July  
And I just hit town and my throat was dry  
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew  
At an old saloon on a street of mud  
There at a table, dealing stud  
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue  
  
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad  
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had  
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye  
He was big and bent and gray and old  
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold  
And I said, ""My name is Sue, how do you do  
Now you're gonna die""  
  
(yeah, that's what I told him)  
  
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes  
And he went down, but to my surprise  
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear  
But I busted a chair right across his teeth  
And we crashed through the wall and into the street  
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer  
  
I tell ya, I've fought tougher men  
But I really can't remember when  
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile  
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss  
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first  
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile  
  
And he said, ""Son, this world is rough  
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough  
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along  
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye  
I knew you'd have to get tough or die  
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""  
  
He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight  
And I know you hate me, and you got the right  
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do  
But ya ought to thank me, before I die  
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye  
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""  
  
Well what could I do? What could I do?  
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun  
And I called him my paw, and he called me his son  
And I came away with a different point of view  
And I think about him, now and then  
Every time I try and every time I win  
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him..  
Bill or George! Any-damn-thing but Sue!  
  
Alright, thank you very much

"The only thing that 'll move me now is a fast song  
Song long and barely known  
And I don't wanna hear no crying all gone wrong song.  
Kick it off and let's all pick a fast song.  
Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune,  
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome tune.  
Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on.  
I'll come in on my part on a fast song.  
Dideldiedie...  
  
Well it don't have to have a banjo or mandelin  
But let it in, if it wants in.  
Keep the rosin' handed and the horse there tough and tight.  
Pick it up and I'm lyable to pick all night.  
Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune,  
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome tune.  
Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on.  
I'll come in on my part on a fast song.  
Repeat last verse, but a little faster.

"A cowpoke rode in, one hot dusty day  
To a store down in old San Antone  
He stood at the window and I heard him say  
Do I have a letter from home  
  
The postmaster looked through the mail that had come  
Then smilingly shook his gray head  
The cowpoke looked sadly a moment at him  
And these are the words that he said  
  
No letter from home, no letter from home  
There's never a letter from home  
No message from mother or none of the others  
There's never a letter from home  
  
That night he was shot on the wrong side of town  
No more of those plains will he roam  
I reached for my Bible and gave it to him  
And said, ""Son here's your letter from home""  
  
""If only I had just a little more time  
To read it"", the young cowpoke said  
""I can't take it with me and I must go on""  
Then he died with his letter unread  
  
The letter from home, the letter from home  
No time for the letter from home  
The cowboy laid dead with his letter unread  
Too late for the letter from home

"Stop lovin' me a little at a time, let me lose you a little at a time  
Walk away slow like you don't want to go, leave me a little at a time  
  
For my benefit try to cry a little bit  
For old times sake give me a slow heartbreak  
I put up a fight but I'll be all right if you stop lovin' me a little at a
time  
  
Hurt me a little at a time, turn me away a little at a time  
Walk away slow like you don't want to go leave me, a little at a time

A little at a time, a little at a time, a little at a time, a little at a time

"How many times have  
You heard someone say  
If I had his money  
I could do things my way  
  
But little they know  
That it's so hard to find  
One rich man in ten  
With a satisfied mind  
  
Once I was waitin'  
In fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed for  
To get a start in life's game  
  
Then suddenly it happened  
I lost every dime  
But I'm richer by far

Money can't buy back  
Your youth when you're old  
Or a friend when you're lonely  
Or a love that's grown cold  
  
The wealthiest person  
Is a pauper at times  
Compared to the man  
With a satisfied mind  
  
When my life has ended  
And my time has run out  
My friends and my loved ones  
I'll leave there's no doubt  
  
But one thing's for certain  
When it comes my time  
I'll leave this old world  
With a satisfied mind

"Always alone alone and blue I've got no one to tell my troubles to  
No one to care to call my own it seems that I must always be alone  
  
The day you left you broke my heart I need you so but we're so far apart  
You didn't care I should have known that you would go and leave me all alone  
  
There is no one to take your place each night in dreams I see your smiling
face  
Then I awake and find you gone I know that I must always be alone

Quite as often as I could have  
Maybe I didn't treat you  
Quite as good as I should have  
If I made you feel second best

But you were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Maybe I didn't hold you  
All those lonely, lonely times  
I guess I never told you  
That I am so happy that you're mine  
If I made you feel second best  
Girl I'm sorry I was blind  
  
But you were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  
Give me, give me one more chance  
To keep you satisfied  
I'll keep you satisfied  
  
Little things I should have said and done  
I just never took the time  
But you were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind

The victor and the loser came by here  
  
No head stones but these bones bring Mascalero death moans  
See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands laying here  
  
Petrified but justified are these Apache tears  
Dead grass dry roots hunger crying in the night  
  
Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here  
And who saw the young squaw they judged by their whiskey law  
  
Tortured 'til she died of pain and fear  
Where the soldiers lay her back are the black Apache tears

Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears

But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes

And stay by my credo till morning is nigh

Close by me forever and love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children in my tender care  
And take us to Heaven to live with Thee there  
  
Please, take us to Heaven to live with Thee there

"Ha ha ha come on bad news ha ha

That I'm bad news, everywhere I go

'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go  
  
I've picked peaches in Georgia, lumberjacked up in Maine  
I've been hired and fired and put in jail in every state you can name  
'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go

"I know that hearts were loving  
Long before I was here.  
And I'm not the first to ever cry  
In my bed or in my beer.  
There were songs before there was radio  
Of love that stays  
And love that goes.  
They were writing melancholy tunes  
And tearful words that rhyme.  
  
[Chorus]  
Before my time.  
Before my time.  
  
There were songs in old dusty books  
Of love that's always been.  
Sweet lovers in their glory  
Who are now gone with the wind.  
Old fashioned love words spoken  
Then keep coming back around again  
Nothing's changed except the name,  
Their love burned just like mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And in the dim of yesterday  
I can clearly see  
That flesh and blood  
Cried out to someone  
As it does in me.  
And there was some old song that said,  
""I love you til I die.""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But what the old time master's had  
Is what I feel for you.  
Love is love and doesn't change  
In a century or two.  
If someway they had seen and knew  
How it would be for me and you  
They'd wish for love like yours  
And they would wish for love like mine.  
  
[Chorus]

"Big John, big John  
  
Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive  
He stood 6 foot 6, weighed 245  
Kind of broad at the shoulders, narrow at the hip  
And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to big John  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
Nobody seemed to know where John called home  
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone  
He didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy  
And if you spoke at all, you'd just said hi to big John  
  
Somebody said he came from New Orleans  
Where he got into a fight over a Cajun Queen  
And a crushing blow from a huge right hand  
Sent a Louisiana fella to the promise land  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
Then came the day at the bottom of the mine  
When a timber cracked and men started crying  
Minors were praying, and hearts beat fast  
And everybody thought they had breathed their last 'cept John  
  
Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell  
Walked a giant of a man that the minors knew well  
Grabbed a sagging timber and gave out with a groan  
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
And with all of his strength, he gave a mighty shove  
Then a minor yelled out, ""There's a light up above!""  
And 20 men scrambled from a would be grave  
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John  
  
With jacks and timbers, they started back down  
Then came that rumble way down in the ground  
And as smoke and gas smelched out of that mine  
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John  
  
Now they never reopened that worthless pit  
They just placed a marble stand in front of it  
These few words are written on that stand  
'At the bottom of this mine, lies one hell of a man, big John'  
  
Big John, big John  
Big, bad John  
Big John

"But the land was already claimed by a people  
When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came  
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways  
A story of tragedy, like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota  
Big Foot was an Indian chief  
Of the Minneconjou band  
A band of Minneconjou Sioux  
From South Dakota land  
Big Foot said to Custer  
""Stay away from Crazy Horse""  
But Custer crossed into Sioux land  
And he never came back across  
Then Big Foot led his people  
To a place called Wounded Knee  
And they found themselves surrounded  
By the 7th Cavalry  
Big chief Big Foot  
Rise up from your bed  
Minneconjou babies cry  
For their mothers lying dead  
Big Foot was down with a fever  
When he reached Wounded Knee  
And his people all were prisoners  
Of the 7th Cavalry  
Two hundred women and children  
And another hundred men  
Raised up a white flag of peace  
But peace did not begin  
An accidental gunshot  
And Big Foot was first to die  
And over the noise of the rifles  
You could hear the babies cry  
Big chief Big Foot  
It's good that you can't see  
Revenge is being wrought  
By Custer's 7th Cavalry  
Then smoke hung over the canyon  
On that cold December day  
All was death and dying  
Around where Big Foot lay  
Farther on up the canyon  
Some had tried to run and hide  
But death showed no favorites  
Women, men, and children died  
One side called it a massacre  
The other a victory  
But the white flag is still waving  
Today at Wounded Knee  
Big chief Big Foot  
Your Minneconjou band  
Is more than remembered here  
In South Dakota land

"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day  
Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say  
No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip  
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town  
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around  
He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip  
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red  
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead  
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four  
And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more  
One and nineteen more  
  
Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around  
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town  
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead  
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red  
After Texas Red  
  
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red  
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead  
Twenty men had tried to take twenty men had made a slip  
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet  
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street  
Folks were watching from their windows every-body held their breath  
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death  
About to meet his death  
  
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play  
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about to-day  
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped  
And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round  
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground  
Oh he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip  
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
Big iron Big iron  
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip The Big Iron on
his hip

Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man  
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin...

"
"I was just a kid roamin' around travelin' through a little ol' town  
A man walked up and said come with me you're broke and son that's vagrancy  
I carefree lad that love to roam but Lord I wish I'd stayed at home  
The way it looks I'll probably hang cause there ain't no hope on a chain gang  
I dig that ditch I chop that corn I curse the day that I was born  
I believe it's better for a man to hang than to work like a dog on a chain
gang  
  
The guard stands there with a great big gun I bet he'd love to see me run  
And I guess I probably will some day I'd rather be dead than to live this way  
He's well fed and he's six foot tall and he's a meanest of them all  
He cracks that whip and he swings that cane the sun must've touched his brain  
I dig that ditch...  
  
I got a gal back home that's sweet and kind and she's been waitin' a long long
time  
I just told her to forget my name I won't ever live down to shame  
Lord deliver me from this hole before I lose my mind and soul  
The place gets weak and the back gets broke ain't no cause to laugh and joke  
I dig that ditch...  
Work like a dog on a chain gang work like a dog on a chain gang

"Words and music by Kaye - Weisman - Fuller  
""The Bad Seeds performed Cindy regularly in their live sets in 1990,and indeed
on a TV appearance as well. I have a version of Elvis Presly doing this song,
but I think it's a traditional, also known as 'I Wish I Was An Apple', or as
'Sydney'. I think The Bad Seeds often sang 'Come on home, Sydney Cindy'
-Maurice  
Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree  
Every time you'd pass me by you'd take a bite of me  
I wish I was a bluebird I'd never fly away  
I'd sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree  
Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee  
Told them that I love you, they all know its true  
Say it till the cows come home until it gets to you  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot  
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot  
Need you in the evening when supper time is through  
What I'm really tryin' to say is I can't get enough of you  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
If I were a musician I'd harp on just one thing  
You should never play my harp the way you pluck a string  
If only you would love me say it and tell me so  
I need two charms about me baby to have the whole world  
Know  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me

"There's a man across the hall who sits staring at the floor  
He thinks he's Hank Williamshear him singing through the door  
There's a girl in 203, who stops by to visit me  
And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be  
There are lots of special people staying in or passing through  
And for one thing or another, committed to Parkview  
There's a girl in 307, coming down on Thorazine  
And a superstar's ex-drummer trying to kick Benzedrine  
There's a boy just down below me, who's the son of some well-known  
He was brought in by his mother, 'cause his daddy's always gone  
There's a bum from down on Broadway and then a few quite well-to-do's  
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview  
There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead  
They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head  
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried  
They just brought him in this morning, an attempted suicide  
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through  
Some came of their own good choosing some committed to Parkview  
They wake us about 6 30, just before the morning meal  
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel  
And I always say ""Fantastic! There ain't nothing wrong with me.""  
And then they give me my injection and I go right back to sleep  
And my days are kind of foggy and my nights are dreamy too  
But they're taking good care of me committed to Parkview

"Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.  
I think you only live to see the lights of town.  
I wasted my time when I wouldn't try, try, try.  
When the lights have lost their glow you're gonna cry,cry, cry.  
  
I lie awake at night and wait 'til you come in.  
You stay a little while and then you're gone again.  
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie.  
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.  
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own,  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.  
  
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.  
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're all alone.  
You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye.""  
When I tun around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry.  
  
When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you.  
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true.  
I'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why, why, why?  
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.  
  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,  
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.  
  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me there,  
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

"From the fountains in the mountains  
Comes the water running cool and clear and blue  
And it comes down from the hills  
And it goes down to the towns and passes through  
When it gets down to the cities  
Then the water turns into a dirty gray  
It's poisoned and polluted  
By the people as it goes along its way  
Don't go near the water children  
See the fish all dead upon the shore  
Don't go near the water  
'Cause the water isn't water anymore  
I took my boy fishin' to my old favorite fishin' hole  
I had caught many a fish out of that deep clear water  
From the time I was a boy like him  
After we'd fished a few minutes  
He said, ""Did you get a bite yet daddy?""  
I said, ""I think I got a nibble son""  
""Me too"", he said  
Then he said, ""Daddy if we catch a fish can we eat him""  
I said, ""Well there was a time son  
This water's bad now and I might not be safe to eat the fish  
But there was a time""  
There was a time the air was clean  
And you could see forever 'cross the plains  
The wind was sweet as honey  
And no one had ever heard of acid rain  
We're torturin' the earth  
And pourin' every kind of evil in the sea  
We violated nature  
And our children have to pay the penalty  
Don't go near the water children  
See the fish all dead upon the shore  
Don't go near the water  
'Cause the water isn't water anymore  
Don't go near the water children  
See the fish all dead upon the shore  
Don't go near the water  
'Cause the water isn't water anymore

"We all were called to come back  
To the old home on the farm  
Mother's passed away, what a mournful day  
And as my daddy watched  
His eyes were filled with pain and hurt  
When someone stepped upon a rose  
And crushed it in the dirt  
""Don't step on Mother's roses,"" Daddy cried  
""She planted them the day she was my bride  
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face  
She made my darkest days look bright  
'Round the old home place""  
""Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow  
The way they did since many years ago  
They'll bloom for me each year  
And I'll have Mother near  
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow""  
Years have passed away  
And how the old home place has changed  
Daddy had to go, we all miss him so  
Children pick the roses as they go along the way  
But when their petals are abused, I hear my daddy say  
""Don't step on Mother's roses,"" Daddy cried  
""She planted them the day she was my bride  
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face  
She made my darkest days look bright  
'Round the old home place""  
""Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow  
The way they did since many years ago  
They'll bloom for me each year  
And I'll have Mother near  
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow""

"I have picked wild roses  
Far into September  
But I had no one to give the flowers to  
I needed the celebration  
of September coronation  
And I admitted to myself I needed you  
  
I've watched the gentle winds change  
The colored shades of meadows  
I've seen the dillon flowers  
That had no name  
But I let my vase stay empty  
Like my old and empty heart  
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same  
  
Don't you think its come our time to be together  
Lets gather up our scattered words of love  
And make them rhyme  
  
Lets go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases  
  
Don't you think its come our time?  
  
Would you take the small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers  
And the feeling that your love is close at hand  
  
Thank you for the flowers  
Now lets walk through the meadows  
To the road where our divines caress the sand  
  
Don't you think its come our time to be together  
Lets gather up our scattered words of love  
And make them rhyme  
  
Lets go pick some flowers now and fill our empty vases  
  
Don't you think its come our time?  
Don't you think its come our time?

"I got a friend named Whiskey Sam  
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam  
He said is my country just a little off track  
Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back  
But, it's better than not comin' back at all  
Many a good men I saw fall  
And even now, every time I dream  
I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream  
  
Drive on, don't mean nothin'  
My children love me, but they don't understand  
And I got a woman who knows her man  
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on  
  
I remember on night, Tex and me  
Rappelled in on a hot L.Z.  
But we had our 16's on rock and roll  
But with all that fire, was scared and cold  
We were crazy, we were wild  
And I have seen the tiger smile  
I spit in a bamboo viper's face  
And I'd be dead, but by God's grace  
  
Drive on, don't mean nothin'  
My children love me, but they don't understand  
And I got a woman who knows her man  
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on  
  
It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain  
And nobody tried to be John Wayne  
I came home, Tex did not  
And I can't talk about the hit he got  
I got a little limp now when I walk  
Got a little tremolo when I talk  
But my letter read from Whiskey Sam  
You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam  
  
Drive on, don't mean nothin'  
My children love me, but they don't understand  
And I got a woman who knows her man  
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on

"Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day

While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong  
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by  
  
When we see Jesus coming in glory when he comes from his home in the sky  
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion we'll understand it all by and

"Oh, I am a cheat and I'm a liar, oh, but you're a lovin' ball of fire

"Beside a singing mountain stream  
Where the willow grew  
  
Where the silver leaf of maple  
Sparkled in the morning dew  
I braided twigs of willows  
Made a string of buckeye beads  
But flesh and blood needs flesh And blood  
And you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need  
  
I leaned against a bark of birch  
And I breathed the honey dew  
I saw a North-bound flock of geese  
Against a sky of baby blue  
Beside the lily pads  
I carved a whistle from a reed  
Mother Nature's quite a lady  
But you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.  
  
A cardinal sang just for me  
And I thanked him for the song  
Then the sun went slowly down the west  
And I had to move along  
These were some of the things  
  
On which my mind and spirit feed  
But flesh and blood need flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.  
  
So when this day was ended  
I was still not satisfied  
For I knew everything I touched  
Would wither and would die  
And love is all that will remain  
And grow from all these seeds  
  
Mother Nature's quite a lady  
But you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.

"Well, it's knowin' that your door is always open  
And your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up  
Stashed behind your couch  
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds  
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines  
That keeps you in the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy  
Planted on their columns now that bind me  
Or somethin' that somebody said 'cause  
They thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're movin' on the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards  
And the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see  
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind  
I dip my cup of soup  
From some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard  
My beard a roughenin' coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can  
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find  
That you're wavin' from the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

"I found him by the railroad track this morning  
I could see that he was nearly dead  
I knelt down beside him and I listened  
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said  
  
He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco  
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done  
I was trying to get back to Louisiana  
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Give my love to Rose please won't you mister  
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes  
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him  
And don't forget to give my love to Rose  
  
Tell them I said thanks for waiting for me  
Tell my boy to help his mom at home  
Tell my Rose to try to find another  
For it ain't right that she should live alone  
  
Mister here's a bag with all my money  
It won't last them long the way it goes  
God bless you for finding me this morning  
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

I know that God ain't no stained glass window

I don't see why my prayers can't get answered right away  
I don't see why some folks keep a load in their mind  
With a sharp axe to grind  
  
And I don't understand why the truth takes a twist  
I don't understand why there is loneliness  
I don't know why they claim some men have no soul  
But there's one thing I do know

God will care for me whenever there is no one else to care  
When no one will be there and no one else will share when no one will God will

"Thank you very much  
This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom prison  
And last night was the first time I've ever sung this song  
Anyways, this song was written by our friend Glen Shirley  
Um, hope we do your song justice Glen, we're going to do our best  
  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
There's a greystone chapel here at Folsom  
A house of worship in this den of sin  
You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom  
But he saved the souls of many lost men  
Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom  
Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock  
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom  
But the door to the House of God is never locked  
  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
  
There are men here that don't ever worship  
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray  
But I've got down on my knees in that greystone chapel  
And I thank the Lord for helpin' me each day  
Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom  
It has a touch of God's hand on ever stone  
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness  
And it's givin' me the strength to carry on  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
  
Have an announcement from Lt. Piper  
Ah, steady  
Uh, Duffy, number nine oh four seven, custody office  
There's a gentleman here I'd like to have stand up, who's a very very proud

This gentleman you all know, the associate warden Mr. Fausman  
Good to see you sir. You want Mr. John Cash, don't ya  
Sorta like to, yes. Johnny  
Johnny a little memento from Folsom prison.

"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count it's many tears  
While we all sup sorrow with the poor  
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's the song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more.  
  
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay  
There are frail forms fainting at the door  
Though their voices now are silent, their pleading look still say  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's a song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more.  
  
There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away  
With a warm heart, whose better days are o'er  
Though her voice should be merry, It's sighing all the day  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's a song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's a side that has wafted across the trouble way  
It's a whale that is heard upon the shore  
It's a dirt that is merriment around the lonely grain  
Oh hard times, come again no more  
  
It's a song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more  
Oh hard times, come again no more!

"I know a man whose plow handle hand is quicker than a light  
Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night  
For he might have to kill or walk around a fight  
  
And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun  
He won't say how many tried and died  
Up against the top hand up against the wrong man cause Hardin' wouldn't run  
  
He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train  
Goin' goin' with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up  
So long Janie chin up I'll be back again  
  
Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried  
Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died  
And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky  
  
Free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did  
First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid  
So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid  
  
Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign  
You won't find him there for business every day at nine  
For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time  
  
Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place  
Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face  
And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace  
  
You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar  
She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there  
Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far  
  
Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin' gun  
Wes Hardin chug-a-luggin' red eye got him in the back of the head  
John Wesley Hardin fell dead cos Hardin wouldn't run

"He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine  
In the little Canan town the word went all around that he turned the water
into wine  
Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee he walked upon the Sea of Galilee  
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and walked upon the Sea of
Galilee  
He turned the water into wine he did my lord now, he turned the water into
wine  
In the little Canan town, the word went all around that he turned the water
into wine  
He fed the hungry multitude, he fed the hungry multitude.  
With a little fish and bread, they said every one was fed, 5000  
He fed the hungry multitude.  
He turned the water into wine.  
He did, just a carpenter from Nazareth,  
He turned the water into wine,  
In the little Cana town, the word went all around,  
He turned the water into wine.  
He turned the water into wine

"On the shores of gitchgoomy by the shining big sea water  
Hiawatha old and grayin' listened to the older prophet listened to Lagu  
And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways  
From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies  
Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha  
""I have seen"" he said, ""A water bigger than the big sea water  
Broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it  
Salty so that none would use it""  
Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting  
And he spoke to all the people  
It's true what Lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision  
I have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning  
And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions  
Bigger than a grove of pine trees, taller than the tallest tree tops  
And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly  
And it carried many people, strange and foreign were these people  
And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered  
Then said Hiawatha, ""I beheld a darker vision""  
Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies  
In our woodlands rang their axes, in our valleys smoked their cities  
Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils  
Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful  
And the man with bearded faces, the men with skin so fair  
With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people  
Farther westward, westward, westward then wild wild and wilder  
Grew the west that once was ours

"Life was a ball of alcohol  
And pills and blues and gals  
And every hung over mornin'  
Was an unheeded warnin'  
That I shared with my lost pals  
  
And the music flowed  
And my chosen road grew wider everyday  
'Til the highs got low and the will said no  
I can't go on that way  
  
Can't go that way, can't go that way  
Yes, the highs got low and the will said no  
I can?t go on that way  
  
Sugar is sweet and good prime meat  
Is so hard to come by  
Saccharine is 'round again  
But today it's do or die  
  
My baby's is home where I belong  
And this is still my day  
I am hangin' on and I am comin' on strong  
And I can't go on that way  
  
Can't go that way, can't go that way  
I'm still hangin' on and comin' on strong  
And I can't go on that way  
  
Up is down and next time around  
I ain't goin' round again  
When it comes my time, I'm gonna stop at the line  
And forget where I've been  
  
Who was it said that alive is dead  
And night to some is day  
Just let her go and let a new wind blow  
'Cause I can go on that way

"
"I saw you walking by his side heard you whisper all those lies  
And I couldn't keep from crying  
You sang him love songs tenderly that should have been for you and me  
And I couldn't keep from crying  
I saw his eyes drinking your charms while he held you in his arms  
Him with all his wedding ways rules your heart now in my place  
I stood and watched him steal a kiss from two lips I know I'll miss  
And I couldn't keep from crying  
  
I saw his eyes drinking your charms...

"I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs  
And when they play them cheatin' tunes, I never sing along  
I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten, born to lose  
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs  
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry  
And I don't think I've ever said I feel like I could die  
I don't ever lay awake, I never think my heart will break  
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry  
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs  
I can't put much feeling in saying love is all gone wrong  
I don't lose no sleep at night 'cause things with you are going right  
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs  
I never call your name out in my sleep  
You never make me worry and you never make me weep  
I never wonder if you're true, I spend a night curled up with you  
And I never call your name out in my sleep  
I hardly ever sing beer

"Well lordy I shall not be, I shall not be moved  
I shall not be, I shall not be moved  
Just like a tree that's growin' in the meadow (down by the water)  
I shall not be moved  
  
I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved  
On my way to glory land I will not be moved  
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water  
I shall not be moved  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I shall not be, I shall not be moved  
I shall not be, I shall not be moved  
Just like a tree that's planted by the water  
I shall not be moved  
  
Well I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved  
On my way to glory land I shall not be moved  
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water  
I shall not be moved  
  
Oh well  
I shall not be, I shall not be moved  
I shall not be, I shall not be moved  
Just like a tree that's planted by the water  
I shall not be moved  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Glory, glory, glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved  
Glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved  
Just like a tree that's planted by the water  
I shall not be moved

"At my door the leaves are falling  
A cold wild wind has come  
Sweethearts walk by together  
And I still miss someone  
  
I go out on a party  
And look for a little fun  
But I find a darkened corner  
because I still miss someone  
  
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes  
I see them every where  
I miss those arms that held me  
When all the love was there  
  
I wonder if she's sorry  
For leavin' what we'd begun  
There's someone for me somewhere  
And I still miss someone

"
"I met an old friend this morning  
And I stopped him and called him by name  
I said, ""The years haven't changed you  
But he said, ""Good Lord, how you've changed!""  
  
So we stood there and talked on the corner  
And remembered the good times we had  
Then he asked if we're happy together  
And I only smiled and I said  
  
""Yes, she keeps me off the streets  
And she keeps me out of trouble  
Sometimes at night, Lord, when I hear the wind  
I wish I was crazy again, yes, I wish I was crazy again""  
  
Then we stopped in at a tavern  
We had us a round or two  
We called ourselves old desperado's, old desperado's  
As old friends are likely to do  
  
We sat for a while and remembered  
Then he said, ""Let's have just one more""  
I said, ""I'd sure like to join you  
But best be goin' on home""  
  
""Yes, she keeps me off the streets  
She keeps me off the streets""
