Don't be a stingy little mama

Now you can spare a kiss or two  
And still have plenty left  
  
Oh no no baby

If you give me just a one sweet kiss

"When a boy like me meets a girl like you  
Then I must believe wishes come true  
I just look at you and I touch your hand  
And this ordinary world becomes a wonderland  
  
There are many girls I have met before  
But I pass them by because I knew  
There would be this magic moment,  
One to last a lifetime through  
When a boy like me meets a girl like you  
  
When a boy like me meets a girl like you

"Now and then, there's a fool such as I  
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye

Now and then, there's a fool such as I  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I am over you  
You taught me how to love and now  
You say that we are through  
I'm a fool but I'll love you dear until the day I die

"Did you ever notice when the sun goes down  
Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound  
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night  
If you listen you can hear it in the breeze  
Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees  
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night  
And the murmuring waters sing the song  
The echoing mountains hum along  
The whispering valleys fill the air  
With a whistling tune our hearts can share  
It's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon  
Listening to old mother nature's favorite tune  
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night

"But now after loving you, what else is there to do  
For honey, all the rest is just gonna have to be second best  
I know I'll go through life comparing her to you  
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you  
  
Your precious love cannot be erased by just another woman with a pretty face  
And your memory, you know it will remain for it cannot be erased  
Other loves may come along, they can't live up to you  
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you

"When everyone thought the world was flat  
Columbus said ""It's round""  
He went down in history  
And America was found  
'Cause  
He had confidence  
A little thing called confidence  
There's no job too immense when you've got  
Confidence

And an ""I"" and a ""D"" and an ""ENCE""  
Put 'em all together and what have you got  
Confidence  
You'll be surprised what you can do  
If you will only try  
Remember the tortoise and the hare  
Who had that famous race  
The speedy hare wound up nowhere  
And slow poke took first place  
'Cause  
He had confidence  
A little thing called confidence

Confidence

How do you know that you can't ride a rainbow in the sky  
You'll be surprised what you can do

"Guadalajara, Guadalajara  
Guadalajara, Guadalajara  
Tienes el alma de provinciana  
Hueles a limpio a rosa temprana  
Ave de jara fresca del rio  
Son mil palomos to case rio  
Guadalajara, Guadalajara  
Sabes a pura tierra mojada  
Ay, ja, ja, ay, ja, ja  
Aj, ja, ja, ay, ja, ja  
Aj colomitos lejanos aj ojitos  
De agua hermanos  
Ay colomitos inolvidables  
Inolvidables como las tardes  
En que la lluvia, des de la loma, ir  
Nos hacia, hasta Zapopam  
Ay misermano ay-ja-ja Mexicano  
Ay colomitos inolvidables  
Inolvidables como las tardes  
En que la lluvia, des de la loma, ir  
Nos hacia, hasta Zapopam  
Guadalajara, Guadalajara

"Well, I quit my job down at the car wash,  
Left my mama a goodbye note,  
By sundown I'd left Kingston,  
With my guitar under my coat,  
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis,  
Got a room at the YMCA,  
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights,  
Just lookin' for a place to play,  
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,  
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.  
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis,  
I run outta money and luck,  
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia,  
On a overloaded poultry truck,  
I thumbed on down to Panama City,  
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,  
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar,  
Makin' music on my guitar,  
I got the same old story at them all night piers,  
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man  
We don't need a guitar man, son  
So I slept in the hobo jungles,  
Roamed a thousand miles of track,  
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,  
At a club they call Big Jack's,  
A little four-piece band was jammin',  
So I took my guitar and I sat in,  
I showed 'em what a band would sound like,  
With a swingin' little guitar man.  
Show 'em, son  
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,  
Find yourself down around Mobile,  
Make it on out to a club called Jack's,  
If you got a little time to kill,  
Just follow that crowd of people,  
You'll wind up out on his dance floor,  
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,  
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,  
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band,  
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man.

"Happy, happy birthday baby  
Although you're with somebody new  
Thought I drop a line to say  
That I wish this happy day would find me beside you.  
Happy, happy birthday baby  
No I can't call you my baby  
Seems like years it was we met  
On a day I can't forget  
Because that's when we fell in love  
Do you remember, the names we had for each other  
I was your pretty, you were my baby  
How could we say goodbye?  
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday  
I'm not acting like a lady  
So I close this note to you  
With good luck and wishes too  
Happy, happy birthday baby

"Some kids born with a silver spoon  
I guess that I was born a little too soon  
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks  
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware  
'Cause I've had my share  
Some kids born as rich as a king  
But I was born without a doggone thing  
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks  
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware  
'Cause I've had my share  
I walked a million miles I bet  
Tired and hungry and cold and wet  
I've heard that lonesome whistle blow  
From New York City down to Mexico  
Some kids born fancy free  
Nobody never gave nothing to me but  
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks  
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware  
'Cause I've had my share  
I walked a million miles I bet  
Tired and hungry and cold and wet  
I've heard that lonesome whistle blow  
From New York City down to Mexico  
Some kids born fancy free  
Nobody never gave nothing to me but  
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks  
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware  
'Cause I've had my share  
I said you'd better beware  
'Cause I've had my share  
I said you'd better beware  
'Cause I've had my share of hard knocks

"Oh I'm really feeling mighty low  
No, no, no, I got no place that I can go  
So I've got some blues to sing  
And oh, so much remembering, woe  
  
Black cats, keep away from me  
Take my advice, go shinning up a tree  
I got hard luck, the hardest kind a luck you'll find  
I ain't lyin', I've got the bluest kinda blues  
Drivin' me right outta my mind  
  
She's gone, said toodle-loo  
Kissed her good-bye and my-my, my money too  
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck you've seen  
I mean, the way I'm runnin' lately  
My lucky number is thirteen  
  
Where do I belong, everything I do is wrong, all wrong  
Wrong as can be  
Who's stacking all the decks, lady luck has got the hex on me  
I'm on her knee  
  
Shove off, oh I'm warning you  
This thing I caught, you know could be catchin' too  
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck there can be  
Yes siree, I guess hard luck always chooses  
Natural born losers like me

"Gonna travel, gonna travel wild and free  
I'm gonna pack my bags because this great big world is calling me  
Every pretty girl's gonna know I'm around  
They're gonna know I'm in town on a harem holiday  
Twenty women, twenty women by my side  
I'm gonna kiss them all, because I've gotta keep 'em satisfied  
Gonna have the best time money can buy  
I'm gonna be flying high on a harem holiday  
If Romeo had a harem holiday  
You can bet that Juliet would have never been his girl forever  
Gonna go back, gonna catch that midnight plane  
Twenty dancing girls are waiting just to call my name  
Gonna have a ball, I ain't gonna waste no time  
I'm gonna make 'em all mine on a harem holiday  
If Romeo had a harem holiday  
You can bet that Juliet would have never been his girl forever  
Gonna travel, gonna travel wild and free  
I'm gonna pack my bags because this great big world is calling me  
Every pretty girl's gonna know I'm around  
They're gonna know I'm in town on a harem holiday

"Now once it was told to me  
We're born with a magic key  
It opens the door to miracles of spring  
  
It takes you to wishing wells  
To ice cream and carousels  
And yet this magic key won't unlock a thing  
  
Unless you have a happy, ya have a happy  
Have a happy, warm smiling face  
I start believin', in believin'  
Let your address, be sunshine place  
  
There's love and there's joy I'm told  
Much more than your heart can hold  
It's there like the ring you would grab  
On a merry-go-round  
  
The world isn't half as gray  
With friends on a rainy day  
But people keep away, when you wear a frown  
  
Unless you have a happy, ya have a happy  
Have a happy, warm smiling face  
I start believin', in believin'  
Let your address, be sunshine place

"Have I told you lately that I love you?  
Could I tell you once again somehow?  
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you?  
Well darling I'm telling you now  
  
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping  
Every dream I dream is you somehow?  
Have I told you why the nights are long  
When you're not with me?  
Well darling I'm telling you now  
  
My heart would break in two if I should lose you  
I'm no good without you anyhow  
And have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darling I'm telling you now  
  
My heart would break in two if I should lose you  
I'm no good without you anyhow  
And have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darling I'm telling you now.

"I long to be His possession  
Oh, He is my everything  
I remember my days of darkness  
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way  
But a whisper of His voice softly calling  
To the arms of my Maker to stay  
  
He is my reason for living,  
Oh He is the king of all kings  
I long to be His possession,  
Oh, He is my everything  
  
After the lighting and thunder  
After the last bell has rung  
I want to bow down before Him  
And hear Him say well done  
  
He is my reason for living  
Oh He is the king of all kings  
I long to be His possession  
Oh, He is my everything

"My Jesus knows when I am Lonely  
He knows each pain, He sees each care  
He understands each lonely heartache  
He understands because He cares  
My Jesus knows just what I need  
Oh yes! He knows just what I need  
He satisfies and every need supplies  
Yes, He knows just what I need  
My Jesus knows just what I need  
Oh yes! He knows just what I need  
He satisfies and every need supplies  
Yes, He knows just what I need
