"So, I prayed...  
But you weren't listening.  
Making miracles?  
So, I begged...  
But you were far away.  
Saving souls perhaps?  
So, I screamed...  
But she was very small  
And you have worlds to mend.  
So, she died...  
And you were glorious.  
But you were somewhere else.  
If you are my shepherd  
Then I'm lost and no one can find me.  
If you are my saviour  
Then I'm dead and no one can help me.  
If you are my glory  
Then I'm sick and no one can cure me.  
If you light my darkness  
Then I'm blind and no one can see me.  
If you are my father  
Then love lies abandoned and bleeding.  
If you are my comfort  
Then nightmares are real and deceiving.  
If you are my answer  
Then I must have asked the wrong question.  
I'd spit on your heaven  
If I could find one to believe in.

"No one's alive  
You could almost be me  
What do you mean  
""Oh, nothing, nothing at all""  
Room eight top floor  
I've seen this man before  
Are you real?  
  
Is it me, is it you  
Cold metal voice  
Of no one's friend it could be mine  
My reflection  
Is no longer me at all  
Am I a fake  
Of the man and are you of me  
Are you real?  
  
Is it me, is it you  
Relax in a backroom  
Oh me oh my oh wouldn't you  
I know your face  
Your connection is broken, boy  
Nothing is new  
Remember? I've got no time  
Are you real?  
  
Is it me, is it you  
Real?  
Real?  
Real?

Over some ex-friends of mine  
In zero cafe number 9  
What you gonna say this time  
  
Basic J, say, are you new here  
  
New ones walking down the stairs  
Pretty young thing but no-one cares  
Jo the waiter drops the tray  
Do you always know your name  
  
Jo the waiter smiled at me  
Jo the waiter's company

A drama is my perfect bride

Do you want to come  
Do you want to come with me now  
  
Nothing here for me now  
I can't believe the noise  
We'll take this place apart  
I won't be here for long  
I know they'll find me soon

I'll question everything  
I'll trade new dreams for old

"Someone is talking  
But it's not conversation,  
Sounds more like a voice in my head.  
It says  
'I live in nightmares  
I'm the new god of panic  
And I'm waiting for you to come home to me.  
  
'So boy, welcome to sleep  
I'm gonna make you, make you, make you bleed.'  
  
I could be dreaming  
But then maybe that's fatal.  
There's nowhere to hide in your dreams.  
I'm so uneasy  
I'm shaking and nervous.  
I'm alone in my room and I'm scared of it.  
  
So, don't let me sleep  
It's gonna make me, make me, make me bleed.  
  
My mother told me  
'Don't believe in ghost stories.  
There's nothing to hurt you in here.'  
But she was wrong  
And now it's come back to haunt me.  
It says it won't leave me alive for long.  
  
I don't want to sleep.  
It's gonna make me, make me, make me bleed.

"I Put my fear back in its box  
And I Put the box where love is blind  
And I walk in the dark  
Where pain waits smiling  
And I know that I can't leave  
I look at what I've become  
I'm a pure and perfect lie  
Like a blind man falling  
Scared and helpless  
And I'm still falling from grace  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blind  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blinded

I don't know why I'm unsure  
And if it all comes down to  
What I'm feeling  
I don't know what I can say  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blind  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blinded  
I stumble  
In the depths of my sin  
On my knees  
I'm a sick man drowning  
I belong  
But for you it's down to  
Who you know  
And do you need this?

Don't leave me blind  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blinded

"Well you're pretty quick to say you love me  
But I've met your kind before  
So I took you twice on our first night  
That doesn't mean I'm going to trust you too far  
  
Love your blue eyes  
When you cry  
Love your blue eyes  
  
You tried to make me crawl far too soon  
But you should know me better by now  
I didn't even feel like trying with you  
I knew that I could break you somehow

"Look up I hear the scream of sirens on the wall  
I see a policeman crying in the backseat of a dying Ford

Who are far too old  
And no-one ever told me  
That I could be so cold  
  
Bombers fight at zero feet  
Bombers fight at zero  
  
I see an old man knocked to the ground  
And beaten by the vicar's wife  
No-one stops to help they're far too busy  
Trying to save their own lives  
A tiny girl screams for mother  
And wanders out into the street  
I saw her going down underneath  
A thousand people's running feet  
  
Bombers fight at zero feet  
Bombers fight at zero  
  
All the junkies pulling needles from their arms  
Hope it lasts all night  
And all the soldiers curse the day they joined the army  
And prepare to fight  
In silent bars, in silent rooms, in silent cars  
You hide where you can  
And me I know just where you are, you see  
I'm a bomber man  
  
Bombers fight at zero feet  
Bombers fight at zero

In his darkness  
I hear screams that hide the voice of God

Pray to me on dominion day'  
'Pray for your salvation  
Sanctuary on dominion day'  
My soul save me

In his mercy  
He will burn the oceans  
In his mercy

Meet the machines  
And play 'Kill by numbers'  
Down in the park  
With a friend called 'Five'

Or was it the war  
But I've never been  
Quite the same  
Little white lies  
Like 'I was there'  
  
Come to 'Zom Zoms'  
A place to eat  
Like it was built  
In one day  
You can watch the humans  
Trying to run  
  
Oh look  
There's a rape machine  
I'd go outside  
If it looked the other way  
You wouldn't believe  
The things they do  
  
Down in the park  
Where the chant is  
'Death, death, death'  
Until the sun cries morning  
Down in the park  
With friends of mine  
  
We are not lovers  
We are not romantics

You hurt my feelings  
You hurt my family  
You hurt my reasons to try

So I've seen my weakness  
And I've seen my heart break  
And I've seen you everytime.  
So I've heard promises  
And I've heard every lie  
And I've heard you everytime.  
You lied to father  
You lied to mother  
You lied to brother and me  
I used to dream, now  
I forget how to  
So should I learn how to lie?  
You take my picture  
You take my ghosts and laugh  
You take my reason  
You take my soul away.  
You take my heartbeat  
You take my innocence  
You take my dreams and  
You'll take my life away.

All sucking from my crazy mind

"Something calls me  
From a dark place  
And so I pray every night  
Something knows me  
It whispers my name  
And I'm losing my faith

But it feels like something dead and cold  
I can feel it waiting  
But it waits for something in my soul

So I beg God  
For salvation, for an angel  
Every night  
And I ask God  
Can He forgive me?  
And I want to believe  
I think I hear it laughing  
But it sounds like my voice lost and old  
I think it showed me Heaven  
And now I know why I'm scared to die  
Am I a fool in the dark, I don't know  
Am I the ghost in my dreams, I don't know  
Am I a shadow of life, I don't know  
Am I afraid of the truth, I don't know  
Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid  
So I ask for  
One small mercy?  
But it whispers 'Who are you?'  
So I ask God  
If He can save me?  
He says 'It's all too dark'

That man's soul is eternal?  
Our prayers are always answered?  
And miracles can happen?  
  
Save me.  
  
But don't you wonder?  
The Holy Ghost and Jesus?  
In paradise and angels?  
That God is all forgiving?  
  
Save me.  
  
Reward the faithful?  
He lies to you and deceives.  
A dark salvation comes.  
Innocence bleeding.  
  
Too dark to see the pictures of Heaven  
Too dark to find the Garden of Eden.  
Blinded by faith and stories of wonder,  
Devine mercy? Mercy lies bleeding.  
  
Save me.

I don't think I want it at all  
  
Long gone. I recall good times  
I must confess I cried  
Me I retired to a back street flat  
Picture 'eyes in a cold steel frame'  
The freaks arrive.  
Broken needles and blood  
'What you on man to get those eyes'  
  
It's very touching I'm so close to me  
False smiles I've rehearsed for days  
Come inside you won't know I'm wrong  
Give me your heart I'm so quickly gone

"
"Treated like a refugee  
Never seems to be a place for me  
In my mind there is a scene i see  
My house is burning  
No-one returning  
To a land once free.  
  
Dreaming like a deportee  
Cast away upon the open sea  
No hand of friendship for the likes of me.  
I feel the thunder  
I'm going under  
And i can't get free.  
  
If there is a heaven  
I don't want to hang around this hell.  
I could be an angel  
Let god (slip? )out of heaven back to hell.  
  
And i say  
I wont cry, no more tears  
I wont cry, no more tears  
  
Carry me away from here  
Cut the crying and the see-through tear  
Make emotion dissappear  
My life is changing  
I'm re-arranging  
Everything i feel.

"
"This heart is empty  
I've barely hidden memories  
I've found a picture that haunts me again  
  
I've no sad expression  
I've no tears in my eyes  
But I am the clown who forgot how to laugh  
  
I wonder, does she think of me?  
I wonder, I wonder  
I wonder, does she call my name?  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
  
Love is like clock law  
Tick tock my heartbeat  
I was a passion that passed her spare time  
  
This room is prison  
Love doesn't come here  
These quiet nights will slowly kill me  
  
I wonder, does she think of me?  
I wonder, I wonder  
I wonder, does she call my name  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me here  
I'm quite alone  

"
"These are words  
Just for you  
Only words  
But it's all I can do  
  
Reasons fade  
As reasons can do  
All I want  
Is to talk with you  
  
You cried with me  
Laughed at me  
Talked to me  
Sheltered me  
Fought by me  
Lied for me  
You lived for me  
  
So call me  
And I'll run to you  
Ask me  
And I'd die for you  
  
You were there  
You were always there  
Like a friend  
Like a lifelong friend  
And I love you  
  
I broke your heart  
And you stole mine  
Memories lie  
But they're all I can find  
  
Call my name  
Sing my song  
Call for me  
I've been waiting so long  
  
Just call me  
And I'll run to you  
Ask me  
And I'd die for you  
  
You were there  
You were always there  
Like a friend  
Like a lifelong friend  
And I miss you  
  

"
"I've seen enough of life,  
Enough to last a lifetime.  
I've seen too many tears,  
Far too many tears.  
I don't know the answer,  
I don't know the question.  
So show me something good,  
Something to believe in.  
CHORUS:  
Love like a ghost, in the dark.  
Love like a ghost, in my heart.  
So let's talk of love,  
Maybe for the last time.  
You will remember me,  
I'm the one who died for you.  
So she'll take everything,  
Everything and nothing.  
I can't do anything,  
Anything at all.  
(repeat chorus to fade)  

"
"She dances  
He watches  
She sighs  
Remember  
Love needs no disguise  
In motion  
That cannot deny  
She's saying  
Love needs no disguise  
And if the park gates are closed  
Remember we toured the skys  
And if the 'friends' all go home  
You know love needs no disguise  
He dances  
And we realised  
Remember  
Love needs no disguise  
In simple embraces  
They lie  
In darkness  
Love needs no disguise  
And we can lock all the doors  
Forget the reasons and fame  
There's no deceiving inside  
You know we'll all be the same  

"
"And m.e. I eat dust  
We're all so run down  
I'd call it my death  
But I'll only fade away  
And I hate to fade alone  
Now there's only m.e.  
  
We were so sure  
We were so wrong  
But there's no one left to see  
And there's no one left to die  
There's only m.e.  
  
Why shoud I care  
Why should I try  
Oh no, oh no  
I turned off the pain  
Like I turned off you all  
Now there's only m.e.

"
"She likes film  
Pictures too  
A friend of mine  
Something new  
  
She likes girls  
Lives my dreams  
Eats my face  
She says 'Time to make me scream'  
  
No crying  
She don't like tears  
My one chance  
Is corruption  
  
(So get up  
So get up and dance)  
  
She likes pain  
'E please Bob'  
Some heroes  
But she don't like God  
  
She likes rock  
MTV  
Sex machines  
She says 'Time to make me bleed'  
  
No romance  
No surprise  
My one chance  
Is perversion  
  
So this is  
My secret  
So this is  
A new way to hide  
  
So this is  
My nightmare  
And you're my  
Solution  
  
No memories  
Nostalgia  
My one chance  
Is slow motion  
  
So this is  
The big lie  
So this is  
My reason to leave  
  
So this is  
My future  
And you're my  
Corruption  
  
She likes speed  
Low fast cars  
Love and hate  
Rock and roll stars  
  
She likes cream  
Long goodbyes  
Someone to watch  
And she says 'Time to make me cry'  
  
I'm nervous  
She scares me  
My one chance  
Is emotion  
  
So this is  
Religion  
So this is  
Something to believe  
  
So this is  
God's disease  
So this is  
A new kind of cure  
  
So this is  
A new world  
And you're my  
Machine and soul  

"
"When I sleep  
I slide into  
Some heaven  
But no one is there.  
  
If I believed,  
If I should wonder,  
If I forgive  
Then would you come for me?  
  
When I sleep  
I hear sad words  
Songs of god  
That show me the lie.  
  
'I'll keep you safe,  
I'll keep you warm and  
I'll keep you here,  
Alone forever.'  
  
And I believe in faith and magic.  
And I believe in love and wonder.  
And I'll believe in you when you come for me.  
And I'll believe in you when the world comes apart

"
"The alarm rang for days  
You could tell from conversations  
I was waiting by the screen  
I couldn't recognize my photograph  
Me, I disconnect from you  
  
I was walking up the stairs  
Something moved in silence  
I could feel his mind decaying  
Only inches away from me  
And I disconnect from you  
  
Please don't turn me off  
I don't know what I'm doing outside  
Me and the telephone that never rings  
If you were me what would you do?  
Me, I disconnect from you

"
"My friends have  
Been demoted to  
Stay  
Second class  
  
Someone tells me  
Reliable  
Big brother will  
Never last  
  
Seems like I  
Outgrew my station  
Sweet young boys turning green  
This is for your information  
  
Mean Street I'd love to see you cry  
Mean Street I'd love to see you die  
Mean Street I really don't know why  
Mean Street you let me down  
  
Look at him  
Taking all our glory  
Let's kick him out  
  
'Who will say?'  
'Don't look at me'  
'He'll find out in a roundabout way'  
  
We don't owe him anything  
We don't need him anymore  
Drop him cold now spread the lies  
No-one even said goodbye  

"
"I don't believe in miracles  
I don't believe in forgiving  
I don't believe in I can go on  
I won't remember why  
I don't believe in long goodbyes  
Never look back for me  
  
It's over  
And everything has gone  
And everything has gone away  
  
I don't remember the faces  
I don't remember the feelings  
I don't remember your stories  
I won't remember you  
I don't remember our secrets  
My God just look at me  
  

"
"These new romantics are oh so boring  
I could swear I've been there once or twice before  
I should grow wings and just forget the club  
You know the legends never wanted to be me  
For too erratic to be OK so?  
If you're concerned well I don't care  
You play games, you play safe  
Me I just sighed with relief  
  
Matthew's mother. The change disturbs me  
You've everybody's friend. Age, I suppose  
Just like religion you're going nowhere  
Like your so explicit clothes onto the floor  
On those occasions when everything broke down  
Including you and me  
  
See the boy, see the girl  
The exhibition is now over

"
"Sometimes they try to forget and sometimes they do  
Giving love for the financial gain  
She's so good with excuses and incorrect reasons  
I'm tired of trying to win and you're tired of me  
  
She knows how to stand in the corner  
And whisper the words that you need  
She knows how to stand in the corner  
And whisper the words with that cynical charm  
We could dance  
Now it's my brother's time  
  
Here on the floor with these very loose young girls  
Like someone in Japan who just lied  
If the innocent are saved then what happens to her  
What's done is done and everything's different somehow  
  
I keep a book of reflections that sometimes appear in her eyes  
I keep a book of reflections  
And realise there's nothing much that I can do  
We could dance  
Now it's my brother's time  
  

"
"Can you see her little eyes?  
Can you see her little hands?  
Don't you think she looks just like me?  
Can you hear her little scream?  
Can you hear her little cry?  
Don't you think she sounds just like me?  
  
[Chorus]  
You have friends and we have reasons  
I can't meet you face-to-face  
There are no corners to hide in my room  
No doors, no windows, no fireplace  
  
My love is only for me  
My love needs nobody else  
Did you know that my love is a liquid?  
I could talk to me for years  
I can't speak to you at all  
Did you know that friends come in boxes?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Save your money buy a tube  
Let your body flow inside  
Watch it grow before your eyes  
Watch it grow before your eyes  
  
[Chorus]

"
"Heartbeat  
I can't see you  
Heartbeat  
I can hear you  
I feel you pumping just beyond my door  
I know exactly  
What you've crawled here for  
Cringe down lower  
You're all dressed in grey  
Me, I'm still breathing  
It's just not your day  
  
I hear you whisper like an open grave  
O.D. Receiver, I am all you crave  
You're dying, crying, I can hear you fall  
Your bony fingers scratching on my wall  
  
O.D. Receiver  
  
I hear you screaming, well at least you try  
Me, I'm still smiling but I don't know why  
I'd call a doctor if I had the time  
But I'm so busy with this fix of mine  
  
O.D. Receiver...  

"
"Now I'm behind glass  
I'll talk to you  
The telephone lines blind  
You have defaced my face  
I bet you laughed at me  
You bright young things  
And now I need no-one  
I miss you, so  
  
Please push no more  
Please push no more  
  
Now it's all over for sure  
I'll walk back home  
We must all come down  
We all grow old  
We are close, we are hurt  
So that was love  
And love she kills me  
It needs to, so  
  
Please push no more  
Please push no more  
  
Please push no more  
Please push no more

"We are deceived  
Valhalla is falling  
We are betrayed  
We are lost and forsaken.  
He's sold the world  
Sold us all to the hunger  
The body of Christ  
Is as black as his soul.  
  
The word of the Lord  
Is the lie of your father  
This mortal sin  
Is a voice of shame.  
Look at the storm  
Like a dying apostle  
Cruel and divine  
Like the ghost of man.  
  
And now you realise  
I am the truth.  
  
Worship the dead  
The damned and misled  
Tortured and bled  
Like the voices of reason.  
Sacred and pure  
Sanctified obsession  
Holy and cured  
Like a doorway to heaven.  
  
Sisterhood cried  
Innocence lied  
Purity died  
With the angels of passion.  
Blessed are they  
Who pay homage to rumour  
I've seen the light  
Shine on the grave of Man.  
  
And now you realise  
I am the truth.  
  
And I believed.  
Amen.

"
"I lose myself in the night  
Walking the streets in the rain.  
I turn away from the light  
To find the shadows again.  
I see her face in the window  
I feel the touch of her hand  
I hear her voice say ""I need you""  
I guess I can't understand  
Radio Heart  
Play a sad song for me  
One fom the heart  
So she'll come back for me  
Radio Heart  
Send her my love for me  
I hear a sound in the night  
Could be the turn of a key  
And when I switch on the light  
It's you I'm hoping to see  
Imagination  
You play a cruel cool game  
Imagination  
You leave me calling her name  
Radio Heart  
Play a sad song for me  
One from the heart  
So she'll come back for me  
The morning after  
I find no inspiration  
No love no laughter  
Just my imagination  

"
"So here am I  
Quite by chance near the phone  
I could call and make you crawl into bed  
  
Questions always questions  
I'll just speak in slow motion  
About obsessions with boys on the floor  
  
Take that smile off your face  
Wipe that tear from your eye  
Don't say sorry for me  
Take that smile off your face  
Wipe that tear from your eye  
Don't say sorry for me  
  
Now look at me  
Like a stormtrooper in drag  
I'll bet you feel exactly like I do  
It's so disgusting  
I'm so tired of  
Rhythm and needles in arms  
I don't want your point of view  
  
Nothing to do  
Nothing to steal  
And there's nothing to say  
Nothing to do  
Nothing to steal  
And there's nothing to say  
  
Oh, don't cry  
Love it, love it  
I need to  
  
Stop it

"I don't know  
I don't know  
The dream was everything  
  
I don't know  
I don't know  
If it's all falling down.  
I lose connection as they let me down  
  
What you gonna think?  
What you gonna do?  
What you gonna say?  
Are you gonna scream 'Oh no'?  
What you gonna think?  
What you gonna do?  
What you gonna say?  
I just don't like this thing, at all.  
(Strange charm)  
  
Let the boys out  
Let the boys out  
And let the fun begin  
  
Let the boys out  
Let the boys out  
And let the night come in.  
  
We don't like it  
We don't like it  
We're from the factory and we've come to play.  
Let the boys out.  
  
You push too hard  
You push too hard  
Come closer and talk to me  
  
You push too hard  
You push too hard  
D'you get the picture now?  
  
You won't like it  
You won't like it  
We get impatient as the time runs out.  
Let the boys out.

"Hello, I'm the aircrash bureau  
I bet you're so surprised to see me  
I could specialize in rumours  
I'll send shivers up your spine  
  
Pilot, back, I need my squadron  
I was flying before d-day  
Now I'm warning you of falling  
I'll tell you when you're going down  
  
Sometimes I get these questions  
It reminds me of the skin game  
We used to stand around on corners  
Saying 'well here we are again'  
  
So now she motions closer  
Now that's what I call romance  
Someone's calling me but vaguely  
You need the feeling not the man

"Put your hate in a box  
See how it bleeds for you  
I've watched you  
Take your life and tear it apart  
  
Put your pain in a box  
I'll send it back to you  
What have you become?  
A shadow of a man  
  
Do you fall like rain on the crying?  
Cold and alone like the bitter and dying  
Do you fall like dust on a ruin?  
Empty and dead like the life you are losing  
  
Put your lies in a box  
How have they worked for you?  
Did they win you back  
The things that you lost?  
  
Put your shame in a box  
How could you be so wrong?  
You sit there broken  
And the world moves on  
  
Do you fall like rain on the crying?  
Cold and alone like the bitter and dying  
Do you fall like dust on a ruin?  
Empty and dead like the life you are losing  
  
How does it feel?  
I'll spare a little thought for ""The Crow""  
How does it feel?  
Living in the black of your soul  
How does it feel?  
Like a beggar out caught in the cold  
How does it feel?  
With nothing but the truth left untold  
  
Do you fall like tears on an ocean?  
Drowning in rage like a poisoned emotion  
Do you fall like a fading desire?  
Lost and unloved a forgotten ""messiah""  
  
Do you fall like rain on the crying?  
Cold and alone like the bitter and dying  
Do you fall like dust on a ruin?  
Empty and dead like the life you are losing

"She's like death on two legs  
She is raw pink shame  
Please stop the God film  
It's all wrong  
But I'm not to blame  
  
These boys of image  
Carry banners  
Believe in slogans  
Kill policeman  
  
Say it's 'freedom'  
Say it's 'goodness'  
Say it's 'peaceful'  
I'm lonely  
I'm feeling down (everyone I know has been and gone)  
  
It's such a sick picture  
She says 'i cure everyone'  
I'm alone in a corner  
I won't ever forgive  
I must be broken  
I don't know  
Who on earth can I blame?

"
"Silently I wait alone for you  
I've got to put my fear back in its box  
Silently I feel you breathe on me  
And I hear mercy sigh and leave the room  
You could hurt me  
Take my breath away.  
Would you like that?  
You could rip me  
Leave me torn and cold.  
Would you like that?  
One More Sin. Make me unforgiven  
Silently, I turn and play begins  
I watch you smile  
Just like a dead things smiles  
Silently I lose and darkness comes  
I hear you laugh as God abandons me  
You could cut me  
Let me die for you.  
Would you like that?  
All I feel. Makes me unforgiven
