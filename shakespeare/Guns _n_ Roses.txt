"I try and feel the sunshine  
You bring the rain  
You try and hold me down  
With your complaints  
You cry and moan and complain  
You whine an tear  
Up to my neck in sorrow  
The touch you bring  
You just don't step inside to 14 years  
So hard to keep my own head...that's what I say  
You know...I've been the beggar...  
I've played the thief  
I was the dog...they all tried to beat  
  
But it's been  
Fourteen years of silence  
It's been  
Fourteen years of pain  
It's been  
Fourteen years that are gone forever  
And I'll never have again  
  
Your stupid girlfriends tell you  
That I'm to blame  
Well - they're all used-up has-beens  
Out of the game  
This time I'll have the last word  
You hear what I say  
I tried to see it your way  
It won't work today  
You don't just step inside to 14 years  
So hard to keep my own head...that's what I say  
You know...I've been the dealer...hangin' on your street  
I was the dog...they all tried to beat  
  
But it's been  
Fourteen years of silence  
It's been  
Fourteen years of pain  
It's been  
Fourteen years that are gone forever  
And I'll never have again  
  
Bullshit and contemplation  
Gossip's their trade  
If they knew half the real truth  
What would they say  
Well I'm past the point of concern  
It's time to play  
These last four years of madness  
Sure put me straight  
You don't get back fourteen years  
In just one day  
So hard to keep my own head  
Just go away  
You know...just like a hooker she said  
Nothin's for free  
Oh I tried to see it your way  
I tried to see it your way

"
"Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Well, she's all geared up, walkin' down the street  
And I can feel the slime, drippin' down her sleeve  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone  
And I can hear her boots as she's near her home  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
[Chorus:]  
Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door  
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore  
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore  
I never should asked for black leather  
Black leather  
Ooh, black leather  
Ow black leather  
  
And you can try to hide, but you won't get far  
You can let her in, and you'll start it again  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Black leather [x 8]

"When all is said and done  
We're not the only ones  
Who look at life this way  
That's what the old folks say  
But every time I'd see them  
Makes me wish I had a gun  
  
If I thought that I was crazy  
Well I guess I'd have more fun  
Guess I'd have more fun  
  
Oh no, no, no, no, no  
  
The Catcher in the Rye again ooh  
Won't let ya get away from him  
It's just another day like today  
  
You decide  
'Cause I don't have to  
Then they'll find  
And I won't ask you  
At anytime  
Or long hereafter  
If the cold's outside  
As I'm imagining  
It to be  
Oh no  
  
The Catcher in the Rye again ooh  
Won't let ya get away from him  
It's just another day like today  
  
When all is said and done  
We're not the only ones  
Who look at life this way  
That's what the young folks say  
But every time I'd see them  
Makes me wish I had a gun  
If I thought that I was crazy  
Well I guess I'd have more fun  
It's what used to be's not there for me  
And ought to find someone that belongs insane like I do  
  
Oh no  
Not at all [Repeat]  
  
On an ordinary day  
Not in an ordinary way  
All at once the song I heard  
No longer wouldn't play for anybody  
Or anyone  
That needed comfort from somebody  
Needed comfort from someone who cared  
To be  
Not like you  
And unlike me  
And then then voices ran away  
From me  
So now you set the wheels in motion  
It haunts our memories  
You were the instrument  
You were the one  
How a body took a body  
And Gave that boy a gun  
You took our innocence  
Beyond our stares  
Sometimes the only thing  
You got at all  
When no one else is there

"Look at your young men fighting  
Look at your women crying  
Look at your young men dying  
The way they've always done before  
  
Look at the hate we're breeding  
Look at the fear we're feeding  
Look at the lives we're leading  
The way we've always done before  
  
My hands are tied  
The billions shift from side to side  
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride  
For the love of God and our human rights  
And all these things are swept aside  
By bloody hands time can't deny  
And are washed away by your genocide  
And history hides the lies of our civil wars  
  
D'you wear a black armband  
When they shot the man  
Who said ""peace could last forever""  
And in my first memories  
They shot Kennedy  
I went numb when I learned to see  
So I never fell for Vietnam  
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all  
That you can't trust freedom  
When it's not in your hands  
When everybody's fightin'  
For their promised land  
And  
  
I don't need your civil war  
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor  
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers  
In a human grocery store  
Ain't that fresh  
I don't need your civil war  
Ow, oh no, no, no, no, no  
  
Look at the shoes you're filling  
Look at the blood we're spilling  
Look at the world we're killing  
The way we've always done before  
Look in the doubt we've wallowed  
Look at the leaders we've followed  
Look at the lies we've swallowed  
And I don't want to hear no more  
  
My hands are tied  
For all I've seen has changed my mind  
But still the wars go on as the years go by  
With no love of God or human rights  
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside  
By bloody hands of the hypnotized  
Who carry the cross of homicide  
And history bears the scars of our civil wars  
  
I don't need your civil war  
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor  
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers  
In a human grocery store  
Ain't that fresh  
I don't need your civil war  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
I don't need your civil war  
I don't need your civil war  
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers  
In a human grocery store  
Ain't that fresh  
I don't need your civil war  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no  
I don't need one more war  
  
I don't need one more war  
No, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no  
Whaz so civil 'bout war anyway?

"(Axl Rose and Gilby Clarke)  
  
Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair  
Talkin' to some rich folk that you know  
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company  
I never thought I'd ever be alone  
  
  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
  
Well when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac  
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day  
Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon  
And another whore to take my pain away  
  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the U.S. Mail  
Say it with dead flowers in my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
No, I won't forget to put roses on your grave

"All I need is some inspiration  
Before I do somebody some harm  
I feel just like a vegetable  
Down here on the farm  
  
Nobody comes to see me  
Nobody here to turn me on  
I ain't even got a lover  
Down here on the farm  
  
They told me to get healthy  
They told me to get some sun  
But boredom eats me like ketchup  
Down here on the farm  
  
Drinking lemonade shanty  
Ain't no body gonna do me harm  
But I'm like a fish out of water  
Down here on the farm  
  
I write a thousand letters  
'Til my fingers all gone numb  
But I never see no postman  
Down here on the farm  
  
I call my baby on the telephone  
I say come down and have some fun  
But she knows what the score is  
Down here on the farm  
  
I can't fall in love with a wheat field  
I can't fall in love with a barn  
When everything smells like horse shit  
Down here on the farm  
  
Blue skies and swimming pools  
Add so much charm  
But I'd rather be back in Soho  
Than down here on the farm  
  
On the fucking farm!  
  
Are you born in a fucking barn or what?  
  
Baaaaaa!

"
"When you're talkin' to yourself  
And nobody's home  
You can fool yourself  
You came in this world alone  
(Alone)  
  
So nobody ever told you baby  
How it was gonna be  
So what'll happen to you baby  
Guess we'll have to wait and see  
One, two  
  
Old at heart but I'm only twenty eight  
And I'm much too young  
To let love break my heart  
Young at heart but it's getting much too late  
To find ourselves so far apart  
  
I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately  
An what more could you ask from me  
How could you say that I never needed you  
When you took everything  
Said you took everything from me  
  
Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait  
When no one I know can seem to help me now  
Old at heart but I musn't hesitate  
If I'm to find my own way out  
  
Still talkin' to myself  
And nobody's home  
(Alone)  
  
So nobody ever told us baby  
How it was gonna be  
So what'll happen to us baby  
Guess we'll have to wait and see  
  
When I find out all the reasons  
Maybe I'll find another way  
Find another day  
With all the changing seasons of my life  
Maybe I'll get it right next time  
An now that you've been broken down  
Got your head out of the clouds  
You're back down on the ground  
  
And you don't talk so loud  
An you don't walk so proud  
Any more, and what for  
  
Well I jumped into the river  
Too many times to make it home  
I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone  
If it doesn't show give it time  
To read between the lines  
  
'Cause I see the storm getting closer  
And the waves they get so high  
Seems everything we've ever known's here  
Why must it drift away and die  
  
I'll never find anyone to replace you  
Guess I'll have to make it through, this time - oh this time  
Without you  
I knew the storm was getting closer  
And all my friends said I was high  
But everything we've ever known's here  
I never wanted it to die

"
"We both lie silently still  
In the dead of the night  
Although we both lie close together  
We feel miles apart inside  
  
Was it something I said or something I did  
Did my words not come out right  
Though I tried not to hurt you  
Though I tried  
But I guess that's why they say  
  
Chorus:  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Just like every night has it's dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Yeah it does  
  
I listen to our favorite song  
Playing on the radio  
Hear the dj say loves a game  
Of easy come and easy go  
But I wonder does he know  
Has he ever felt like this  
And I know you'd be here right now  
If I could have let you know somehow  
I guess  
  
Chorus  
  
Though it's been a while now  
I can still feel so much pain  
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals  
But the scar, that scar remains  
  
I know I could have saved our love that night  
If I'd known what to say  
Instead of makin' love  
We both made our separate ways  
But now I hear you found somebody new  
And that I never meant that much to you  
To hear that tears me up inside  
And to see you cuts me like a knife  
I guess  
  
Chorus

"She's a good girl, loves her mama  
loves Jesus and America too  
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis  
loves horses and her boyfriend too  
  
It's a long day livin' in Reseda  
there's a freeway runnin' through the yard  
and I'm a bad boy, 'cause I don't even miss her  
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart  
  
And I'm free, I'm free fallin'  
  
All the vampires walkin' through the valley  
move west down Ventura Blvd.  
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows  
All the good girls are home with broken hearts  
  
I wanna glide down over Mulholland  
I wanna write her name in the sky  
I wanna free fall out into nothin'  
Gonna leave this world for awhile

"It's a critical solution  
And the east coast got the blues  
It's a mass of confusion  
Like the lies they sell to you  
  
You got a glass jawed toothache  
Of a mental disease  
An they be runnin' round back  
See 'em line up on their knees  
Cause the kiss ass sycophants  
Throwin' penance at your feet  
  
When they got nowhere to go  
Watch 'em come in off the streets  
While they're bangin' out front  
Inside their slammin' to the cruch  
Go on an throw me to the lions  
And the whole damn screamin' bunch  
Cause the pissed-off rip-offs  
Are' everywhere you turn  
Tell me how a generation's  
Ever s'posed to learn  
This fire is burnin'  
And it's out of control  
It's not a problem you can stop  
It's rock n' roll  
  
I read it on a wall  
It went straight to my head  
It said Dance to the tension  
Of a world on edge  
We got racial violence  
And who'll cast the first stone  
And sex is used anyway it can be  
Sometimes when I look out  
It's hard to see the day  
It's a feelin' you can have it  
It's not mine to take away  
  
Lost in the garden of Eden  
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden  
And there's no one's gonna believe this  
But we're lost in the garden of Eden  
This fire is burnin'  
And it's out of control  
It's not a problem you can stop  
It's rock n' roll  
Suck on that  
  
Looking through this point of view  
There's no way I'm gonna fit in  
Don't ya tell me what my eyes see  
Don't ya tell me who to believe in  
I ain't superstitious  
But I know when somethin's wrong  
I've been draggin' my heels  
With a bitch called hope  
Let the undercurrent drag me along  
  
Lost in the garden of Eden  
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden  
And there's no one's gonna believe this  
But we're lost in the garden of Eden  
  
Most organized religions make  
A mockery of humanity  
Our governments are dangerous  
And out of control  
The garden of Eden is just another graveyard  
Said if they had someone to buy it  
Said I'm sure they'd sell my soul  
  
This fire is burnin'  
And it's out of control  
It's not a problem you can stop  
It's rock n' roll  
Lost in the garden of Eden  
(An we ain't talkin' about no poison apple or some missin' rib ya hear)  
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden  
And there's no one's gonna believe this  
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden  
This fire is burnin'  
And it's out of control  
It's not a problem you can stop  
It's rock n' roll

"Well, since my baby left me,  
I found a new place to dwell.  
It's down at the end of lonely street  
At Heartbreak Hotel.  
  
You make me so lonely baby,  
I get so lonely,  
I get so lonely I could die.  
  
And although it's always crowded,  
You still can find some room.  
Where broken hearted lovers  
Do cry away their gloom.  
  
You make me so lonely baby,  
I get so lonely,  
I get so lonely I could die.

Too appalling for me

Would ever mean so much to me  
In my heart I found the feelings that I've never shown  
Now they've got the best of me

I never thought all the love I was looking for  
Could ever be so close to me  
Your the only one that I've ever loved that has ever loved me

All the dreams we had would all just drift away  
You know there's nothing more to say

It isn't hard to do  
Nothing to kill or die for  
And no religion too  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And the world will be as one  
  
Imagine no possessions  
I wonder if you can  
No need for greed or hunger  
A brotherhood of man  
Imagine all the people  
Sharing all the world...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And the world will live as one

Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head.  
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas!  
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash,  
It's a Gas! Gas! Gas!  
  
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash

"Sail away sweet sister  
Sail across the sea  
Maybe you'll find somebody  
That will love you half as much as me  
My heart is always with you  
No matter what you do  
So sail away sweet sister  
Cause I'll always be in love with you  
  
[From this point on is actually from ""Bad Time"" by Grand Funk Railroad]  
But let her be somebody else's queen  
I don't want to know about you  
'cause too many others know what I mean  
And that's why I got to live without you  
  
I'm in love with a girl  
I'm talkin' about  
I'm in love with a girl  
That I can't live without  
I'm in love but it feels like  
I'm livin' it out  
I'm in love but I must have picked a Bad Time  
To be in love

"
"You better change your attitude  
Cause you know you want it to  
You bring me all your pride  
But I know you hold it too  
I can feed your bounty, yeah  
If you feed my head as well  
And I won't give you empty promises, yeah  
When the quarter's in the wishing well  
  
But this ain't no sentimental movie  
Where dreams collect like dust  
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes  
So now, who can you trust?  
  
You think you look so cool  
Yes you do  
You take me for your fool, yeah  
Itching' for your... Of the hug  
Baby I want a new start, but don't you be true, yeah  
I can see through your door  
You put my head into these walls  
You take my heart to the dockside, yeah  
You put me in the car  
And take me for another ride  
  
But this ain't no sentimental movie  
Where dreams collect like dust  
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes  
So now, who can you trust?  
Trust  
Trust  
  
Put a path on to your veins  
And antique and old whore's our new pain, yeah  
The tears you cried  
All the tears you cried tonight  
Yeah  
You put me down  
But you can't get out of sight  
  
And this ain't no sentimental movie  
You push it on  
You grab it on  
But I don't see the tv?  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
Yeah, see the screen  
You're startin' to scream  
Abusin' confusin'  
Your program's over?  
  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
Yeah, you look so cool  
Don't take me for another one of your scenes?  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
The tears you cried  
All the tears you cried tonight  
Yeah  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
This ain't no sentimental movie  
This ain't no sentimental movie

"I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I said I don't know what I did  
But I know I gotta move  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I can't wait here forever  
I got too much here to lose  
  
An now you're blowin' smoke  
I think you're one big joke  
Me...I gotta lot to learn  
An I'm still waitin' for the heads to turn  
You say I walk a line  
Fuck they move it every time  
You walk a mile in my shoes  
And then you tell me 'bout singin' the blues  
You get what you pay for  
An freedom's real high priced  
An while your rippin' off children  
Somebody's fuckin' your wife  
It's never made a difference  
It's only how you survive  
  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I said I don't know what I did  
But I know I gotta move  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I can't wait here forever  
I got too much here to lose  
An now you ask me why  
I said it's do or die  
I'll stick it right in your face  
And then I'll put you in your motherfuckin' place  
And you...you can suck my ass  
An I think it's so low class  
Me...I'm just so concerned  
I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn  
Ooooh you want a confrontation  
I'll give you every fuckin' chance  
With your verbal masturbation  
Me...I just like to dance  
How's that for provocation  
I'm just makin' a stance  
An I'm tired of the frustration  
Of livin' inside of your lies  
And I'm wired on indignation  
I said somebody's got to die  
  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I said I don't know what I did  
But I know I gotta move  
I got the shotgun blues

I got too much here to lose  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
Listen motherfucker  
You're about to pay your dues  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
If you're goin' up against me  
Then you know you're gonna lose  
I know  
I know (there's ways- that we- can find)  
I know  
I know  
  
You think anyone with an I.Q. over fifteen  
Would believe your shit...fuckhead  
Nothin' but a fuckin' pussy

"She's got a smile that  
It seems to me  
Reminds me of childhood memories  
Where everything  
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky  
Now and then when I see her face  
She takes me away to that special place  
And if I'd stare too long  
I'd probably break down and cry  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Sweet child o' mine  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet love of mine  
  
She's got eyes of the bluest skies  
As if they thought of rain  
I hate to look into those eyes  
And see an ounce of pain  
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place  
Where as a child I'd hide  
And pray for the thunder  
And the rain  
To quietly pass me by  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Sweet child o' mine  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet love of mine  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet child o' mine  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet love of mine  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet child o' mine  
Oh,  
Sweet love of mine  
  
Where do we go?  
Where do we go now?  
Where do we go?  
Oh, oh  
Where do we go?  
Oh,  
Where do we go now?  
Where do we go?  
Oh, (sweet child)  
Where do we go now?  
Oh,  
Where do we go now?  
Oh,  
Where do we go?  
Oh,  
Where do we go now?  
Oh,  
Where do we go?  
Where do we go now?  
Where do we go?  
Oh,  
Where do we go now?  
No, no, no, no, no, no

"You know you're all alone  
Your friends they aren't at home  
Everybody's gone to the garden  
As you look into the trees  
You can look but you don't see  
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden  
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care  
What's it with you man, and this garden  
  
Turned into my worst phobia  
A crazy man's utopia  
If you're lost no one can show ya  
But it sure was glad to know ya  
Only poor boys take a chance  
On the garden's song and dance  
Feel her flowers as they wrap around  
But only smart boys do without  
  
You can find it all inside  
No need to wrestle with your pride  
No you ain't losin' your mind  
You're just in the garden  
They can lead you to yourself  
Or you can throw it on the shelf  
But you know you can look inside  
For the garden  
  
I wasn't really scared  
Lost my virginity there  
To a gypsy with blond hair  
But now no one seems to care  
Like a mouse inside a maze  
Wandering 'round four days  
With a smile upon my face  
I never want to leave this place  
Only poor boys take a chance  
On the garden's song and dance  
Feel her flowers as they wrap around  
But only smart boys do without  
Turned into my worst phobia  
A crazy man's utopia  
If you're lost no one can show ya  
But it sure was glad to know ya  
Bye bye  
So long, bye bye  
It's glad to know ya  
Bye bye  
Bye bye  
Aw...so long

"Wanna tell you a story  
'Bout a woman I know  
When it comes to lovin'  
Oh she steals the show  
She ain't exactly pretty  
Ain't exactly small  
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six  
You could say she's got it all  
Never had a woman  
Never had a woman like you  
Doing all the things  
Doing all the things you do  
Ain't no fairy story  
Ain't no skin and bone  
But you give it all you got  
Weighing in at nineteen stone  
You're a whole lotta woman  
A whole lotta woman  
Whole lotta Rosie  
And you're a whole lotta woman  
Oh honey you can do it  
Do it to me all night long  
Only one to turn  
Only one to turn me on  
All through the night time  
And right around the clock  
To my surprise  
Rosie never stops

"Childhood living is easy to do  
The things you wanted  
I bought them for you graceless lady  
You know who I am  
You know I can't let you slide through my hand  
  
Wild horses  
Couldn't drag me away  
Wild, wild horses  
Couldn't drag me away  
  
I watched you suffer  
A dull aching pain  
Now you're decided  
To show me the same  
No sweeping exits  
Or offstage lines  
Could make me feel bitter  
Or treat you unkind  
  
I know I've dreamed you  
A sin n' a lie  
I have my freedom  
But I don't have much time  
Faith has been broken  
Tears must be cried  
Let's do some living  
After we die  
  
Wild horses  
Couldn't drag me away  
Wild, wild horses  
Couldn't drag me away

"Yesterday, there was so many things  
I was never told  
Now that I'm startin' to learn  
I feel I'm growin' old  
  
'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Old pictures that I'll always see  
Time just fades the pages  
In my book of memories  
Prayers in my pocket  
And no hand in destiny  
I'll keep on movin' along  
With no time to plant my feet  
  
'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Old pictures that I'll always see  
Some things could be better  
If we'd all just let them be  
  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Got nothin' for me  
  
Yesterday there were so many things  
I was never shown  
Suddenly this time I found  
I'm on the streets and I'm all alone  
  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Old pictures that I'll always see  
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties  
  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Yesterday  
  
Yesterday

"It doesn't pay to try  
All the smart boys know why  
It doesn't mean, I didn't try  
I just never know, why  
  
It isn't 'cause I'm all alone  
Oh, baby, you're not home  
And when I'm home  
Big deal, I'm still alone  
  
It's so restless, I am  
Beat my head against a pole  
Try to knock some sense, down 'side my bones  
And even though it don't show  
Those guys are so old  
  
[Chorus:]  
Can't put your arms around a memory  
Can't put your arms around a memory  
Can't put your arms around a memory  
Don't try  
Don't try  
  
You're just a basket case  
And you got no name  
Could you live with me?  
Go on and say  
And even though it don't show  
Those guys are so old  
Can't put your arms around a memory  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Johnny you're me  
Yeah, you're memory  
I want to put my arms around your memory  
I can't try, I can't try...don't try
