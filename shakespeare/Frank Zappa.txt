We'll get a smilin' nazi  
And march him right on through

We'll sell him in the movies  
On the tube throughout the year  
We'll sell him by the buckets  
To the Okies drinking beer  
We'll teach him how to walk and talk  
We'll putty up his chin  
We'll print his picture everywhere  
Of course the schmuck will win  
  
From the heart of old Death Valley  
To the ruling of our land  
A simple trick, you simple pigs  
Just the way we planned

"She had that  
Camarillo brillo  
Flamin' out along her head,  
I mean her Mendocino bean-o  
By where some bugs had made it red  
She ruled the Toads of the Short Forest  
And every newt in Idaho  
And every cricket who had chorused  
By the bush in Buffalo  
She said she was  
A Magic Mama  
And she could throw a mean Tarot  
And carried on without a comma  
That she was someone I should know  
She had a snake for a pet  
And an amulet  
And she was breeding a dwarf  
But she wasn't done yet  
She had gray-green skin  
A doll with a pin  
I told her she was awright  
But I couldn't come in  
(I couldn't come in right then . . . )  
And so she wandered  
Trough the door-way  
Just like a shadow from the tomb  
She said her stereo was four-way  
An' I'd just love it in her room  
Well, I was born  
To have adventure  
So I just followed up the steps  
Right past her fuming incense stencher  
To where she hung her castanets  
She stripped away  
Her rancid poncho  
An' laid out naked by the door  
We did it till we were un-concho  
An' it was useless any more  
She had a snake for a pet  
And an amulet  
And she was breeding a dwarf  
But she wasn't done yet  
She had gray-green skin  
A doll with a pin  
I told her she was awright  
But I couldn't come in  
(actually, I was very busy then)  
And so she wandered  
Through the door-way

She said her stereo was four-way  
An' I'd just love it in her room

Is that a Mexican poncho or is that a Sears poncho?

"Dreamed I was an Eskimo  
Frozen wind began to blow  
Under my boots 'n around my toe  
Frost had bit the ground below  
It was a hundred degrees below zero  
  
And my mama cried  
And my mama cried  
Nanook, a-no-no  
Nanook, a-no-no  
Don't be a naughty Eskimo  
Save your money, don't go to the show  
  
Well I turned around and I said oh, oh oh  
Well I turned around and I said oh, oh oh  
Well I turned around and I said ho, ho  
And the northern lights commenced to glow  
And she said, with a tear in her eye  
Watch out where the huskies go, and don't you eat that yellow snow  
Watch out where the huskies go, and don't you eat that yellow snow

Baby baby why you cryin'  
Feeling sorry what she said  
Put down the rag, I told her then  
Don't wanna hear you cry again  
Dear heart, dear heart  
Tell me, tell me what's the reason  
Dear heart, dear heart  
Tell me, tell me what's the reason  
You know she went to see the doctor  
And then she read a magazine  
Forget that book, I told her then  
Don't wanna hear about the book again  
Dear heart, dear heart  
Work out, vinnie  
Tell me, tell me what's the reason  
Dear heart, dear heart  
I thought you were in love, vinnie  
Tell me, tell me what's the reason  
There was a picture on the story  
That showed a young sophisticator  
Who falls in love three pages later  
With some aggressive agitator  
And by and by he comes to hate her  
'cause she don't shave her underarms  
And he can't go for that  
'cause he's a young sophisticator  
Baby baby why you cryin'  
It made me wonder what she said  
Forget that book I told her then  
Don't wanna hear 'bout the book again  
Dear heart, dear heart  
Tell me, tell me what's the reason  
Dear heart, dear heart  
How you doin', vinnie?  
Tell me, tell me what's the reason  
Would you still love me if my hair grew  
All down the side of my kimono  
Well of course I would, it might be hip  
If it did not cause you to trip  
Dear heart, dear heart  
Or radiate a bad aroma  
Dear heart, dear heart  
Or radiate a cheap aroma  
Dear heart, dear heart  
Or radia-iate, or radia-ia-ia-iate a butzis aroma  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

A year ago today  
Was when you went away  
But now you come back knockin' on my door  
And you say you're back to stay,  
But I say...  
Go cry  
On somebody else's shoulder  
I'm somewhat wiser now  
And one whole year older  
I sure don't need you now  
And I don't love you  
Anymore  
You cheated me baby,  
And told some dirty lies about me  
Fooled around with all those other guys  
That's why I had to set you free  
I sure don't need you now  
And I don't love you  
Anymore  
A year ago today  
You went away  
And now you come back crying  
Crying, crying: please, let me in  
But I don't need you  
No I don't love you anymore  
So go lean on...go cry on  
Somebody else's door  
Go cry  
On somebody else's shoulder  
I'm somewhat wiser now  
And one whole year older  
I sure don't need you now  
And I don't love you  
Anymore (oh, my darling!)  
(spoken:)  
Go ahead and cry  
Go ahead and let the tears fall outa your eye  
Let 'em fall on your dress  
Who cares if it makes a mess?  
I gave you my high school ring  
At the root beer stand  
We had a teen-age love baby  
I thought it was sharp  
It was really so grand...but  
You cheated me baby  
And told some dirty lies about me  
Fooled around with all those other guys  
That's why I had to get my khakis pressed  
I sure don't need you now  
And I don't love you  
Anymore  
(spoken:)  
Baby, I love you so much, darling  
Why don't you dig me?  
I dig you  
But you don't dig me  
I don't understand what it is  
I had my car re-upholstered  
I got my hair processed  
I got a nice pompadour job on it  
I bought a new pair of shoes  
I got some new khakis and I met you  
And we went out to get a coca-cola...

Say!  
Imagine me and you,  
I do,  
I think about you day and night  
It's only right,  
To think about the girl you love  
And hold her tight,  
So happy together  
If i should call you up,  
Invest a dime  
And you say you belong to me,  
And ease my mind  
Imagine how the world would be,  
So very fine,  
So happy together  
(just like a big rock-show)  
  
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life  
When you're with me, baby,  
The skies will be blue for all my life

Down the fillmore, but ah, i'm sure he'll get into somethin' better  
It's been lovely, workin' for you this evenin'  
Good night, good night, good night boys and girls!

We must say good-bye  
There's no need for you to cry  
It's better that I tell you this tonight  
Our affair has been quite heated  
You thought I was what you needed  
But the time has come, my darlin'  
To set things right, 'cause  
I'll be harder than yer husband  
To get along with  
Harder than yer husband every night  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer husband  
An' I don't want our love affair  
To end with a fight  
You been like a little angel  
How you loved me  
I appreciate the warmth of your embrace  
Well, the world don't need to know  
How I adored you  
But there's somethin' I must tell you, darlin'  
Face to face...  
I'll be harder than yer husband  
To get along with  
Harder than yer husband every night  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer husband  
An' I don't want our love affair  
To end with a fight  
So it's adios, adios, my little darlin'  
(adios my little darlin'...)  
Gotta go now...  
Keep that hankie that I gave you for  
When you cry  
There are things that trouble me  
And I'm sure that you must see  
That it breaks my heart the same as yours  
When we say good-bye  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...much, much, much  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...much, much, much  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...much, much, much  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...

Mr. america, walk on by your schools that do not teach  
Mr. america, walk on by the minds that won't be reached  
Mr. america try to hide the emptiness that's you inside  
But once you find that the way you lied  
And all the corny tricks you tried  
Will not forestall the rising tide of hungry freaks daddy!  
They won't go for no more  
Great mid-western hardware store  
Philosophy that turns away  
From those who aren't afraid to say what's on their minds  
The left behinds of the great society  
Hungry freaks, daddy!  
Mr. america, walk on by your supermarket dream  
Mr. america, walk on by the liquor store supreme  
Mr. america try to hide the product of your savage pride  
The useful minds that it denied  
The day you shrugged and stepped aside  
You saw their clothes, and then you cried,  
""those hungry freaks, daddy!""  
They won't go on four no more  
Great mid-western hardware store  
Philosophy that turns away  
From those who aren't afraid to say what's on their minds  
The left behinds of the great society
