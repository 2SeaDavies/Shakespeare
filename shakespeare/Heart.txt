"Hey hot shot boy  
Hand on your hip  
You're wasting your time  
Giving me lip  
When you look at me, it melts my legs  
And wraps me around your fingertip  
  
You don't have to say a word  
To get hold of me  
Take me, shake me  
Burning gravity baby  
Look at me  
Look at me  
  
[Chorus]  
You're all eyes, all eyes  
Touching me in the night  
You're all eyes - and those eyes  
Are tearing me up inside  
  
We go walking you and i  
If some woman turns your eye  
I pull you back in my direction  
Too keep you by my side  
  
You don't have to go nowhere  
To get where you should be  
You don't have to look around  
Just you look at me - look at me - look at me  
  
[Chorus: x 4]

"It was a rainy night when he came into sight  
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat  
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride  
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while  
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain  
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight  
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Say you will you want me too  
All I want to do is make love to you  
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to  
  
So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well  
We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right  
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily  
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note  
I told him I am the flower you are the seed  
We walked in the garden we planted a tree  
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare  
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All want to do is make love to you  
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to  
  
Oh, oooh, we made love  
Love like strangers  
All night long  
We made love  
  
Then it happened one day, we came round the same way  
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes  
I said please, please understand  
I'm in love with another man  
And what he couldn't give me  
was the one little thing that you can  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Come on, say you will, you want me too  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Say you will, you want me too  
  
All night long...

"
"Forgive me I can't stay here anymore  
I'm leaving with the tide  
This evening another breeze blew 'round my door and stirred me up inside  
I'm breaking out of this tired old spell  
I played it out long and so well  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
Back to Avalon  
Where I'm going all my demons disappear  
I'm leaving them behind  
I'm travelling way up on the atmosphere  
'Cause I made up my mind  
Gonna find my love  
Gonna find my life  
Gonna look them so deep in the eye  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
Back to Avalon  
Nobody knows what's inside my head or down this road  
Oh I know I'm going home  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
Back to Avalon

"They walk into the lobby  
The pack in black  
Heads are turning  
But they don't look back  
  
They must be crazy  
Not buying in  
Why these outsiders  
Get to shock and offend  
  
They're bad animals - bad animals  
Got to swim upstream got a rebel seed  
Bad animals - bad animals  
Got to push the grain or go insane  
  
Out here on the frontline  
Our territory is nighttime  
We walk the jungle line  
We stay alive  
  
Bad, bad, bad boys and dangerous girls  
Ain't got no prescription  
They make their own styles  
  
Typical family  
Trying not to stare  
Look a little closer now  
If you dare, if you dare, if you dare  
  
Bad animals - bad animals  
Got to swim upstream got a rebel seed  
Bad animals - bad animals  
Got to push the grain or go insane  
  
Out here on the frontline  
Our territory is nighttime  
We walk the jungle line  
We stay alive  
  
Bad animals - bad animals  
Got to swim upstream got a rebel seed  
Bad, bad, bad animals - bad animals  
Got to push the grain or go insane

"So this ain't the end, I saw you again, today  
I had to turn my heart away  
Smiled like the sun, kisses for everyone  
And tales, it never fails  
  
You lying so low in the weeds  
I bet you gonna ambush me  
You'd have me down, down, down on my knees  
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda? Oh  
  
Back over time we were all trying for free  
You met the porpoise and me  
No right, no wrong you're selling a song, a name  
Whisper game  
  
If the real thing don't do the trick  
You better make up something quick  
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick  
Oooo, Barracuda, oh yeah  
  
""Sell me, sell you"" the porpoise said  
Dive down deep to save my head  
You, I think you got the blues too  
  
All that night and all the next  
Swam without looking back  
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools  
  
If the real thing don't do the trick, no  
You better make up something quick  
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick  
Oooo, Barra-Barracuda

"Daddy's little soldier boy  
Mama's little pride and joy  
Both hands on her apron strings  
""Don't you touch that dirty thing""  
A warning signal from above  
Inspection with a clean white glove  
They say that opposites attract  
like right and wrong  
Black on black  
  
Like pleasure and a little pain  
The sacred and profane  
Ice and fire counteract like black on black  
The oldest story known to man  
The willing sacrificial lamb  
Behind the light a shadow falls  
The code of silence shakes the walls  
A whisper to a silent scream  
The power is so frightening  
They say that opposites attract  
like right and wrong  
Black on black  
  
Like pleasure and a little pain  
The sacred and profane  
Ice and fire counteract just like black on black  
A warning signal from above  
Inspection with a clean white glove  
They say that opposites attract  
like right and wrong  
Black on black  
  
Some things seem so sacred  
Like a loaded question the power of suggestion  
Like the face of danger the kindness of a stranger  
Like a Judas Kiss like pleasure and a little pain  
Immaculate seduction absolute corruption  
Ice and fire counteract no turning back  
like black on black  
Black on black.  
Black on black  
  
Like pleasure and a little pain  
The sacred and profane  
Ice and fire counteract like black on black  
Like pleasure and a little pain  
The sacred and profane  
Ice and fire counteract just like black on black  
Black  
A little pain  
Just like black on black

Black on black  
Black on black

"Young girl feeling pretty old  
Young girl in the band  
Rolling into another town  
Living the best they can  
Across the street, a music store  
She gotta find a brand new axe  
And there he was, that blue guitar  
He was staring her right back, staring her right back  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
She made herself a local scene  
And man that axe could sing and scream  
Crying for a big breakthrough  
Only small time local news  
Just about to pack it in  
Mr. Money Biz rolled in  
Paid the way and broke the band  
A living one night stand, living one night stand  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire  
Take this platinum, take this gold  
Burn too hot, it turns you cold  
Nothin' left to hold on to  
But that guitar was always true, that man was always true  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire

"The dust is gathering where I stand  
Now I know there's a crack in this plan  
After a while there just ain't no more  
Magic, man  
  
I got a need  
I got to know  
Give me the truth who is running my show  
Tell them I'm sorry but I just had to go  
  
My patience ran out  
I gotta run  
Out of a habit that used to be fun  
  
I just wanna break  
Shake it, shake it, shake it off  
Take off, break it off  
Break, break  
  
Break me outta here  
You know what it's about  
Let me out, get me out  
Break  
  
I go no more respect for the big man  
Pulling me down to what he understands  
He can't get his mind around no bigger plans  
No one is going to tie me to this machine  
Giving me formula force fed dreams  
Getting more hold on me than it seems  
  
My patience ran out  
I gotta run  
Out of a habit  
That used to be fun  
  
I just gotta break  
Shake it, shake it, shake it off  
Take off, break it off  
Break, break  
  
Break me out of here  
You know what it's about  
Let me out, get me out

"How long have I been watching from my window Running through my life  
Watching it all go by Seems like I've always got a destination  
Running down the time Pushing to the front of the line  
I want to be where the snow is falling Voices of friends like angels calling  
  
(Out in the pines - oh beautiful tree)  
I want to be there where Christmas waits for me  
Christmas waits Gather round the fire let the weather rage outside  
Christmas waits I always will be welcome for the rest of my life Christmas
waits

"Young man is angry, girl is afraid  
She want to get high and he want to get paid  
She had to jump up, he had to sit down  
When they heard those words about the trouble downtown  
He had to shout, she had to cry  
He wanted to kill and she wanted to die  
City's burning  
Cities burning  
City's burning  
Cities burning  
Grab for the dial, tune out the fright  
But he turns left and she turns right  
She look for love songs, he buys the drive  
But all they can pull is bad news in tonight  
City's burning  
Cities burning  
City's burning  
Cities burning  
Ooh mama, tell me what to do?  
Aah daddy you better pull us through  
Ooh mama, mama, mama, tell me what to do?  
Daddy, you better pull us through  
Young man is angry, girl is afraid  
He want to get high and she want to get paid  
City's burning  
Cities burning

City's burning

"Poor little dreamer  
Stand inside the door  
You can't find the easy rhymes  
Of time you had before  
  
It hurts my heart so bad  
Seeing you sigh and shake  
Broken down so low, so sad  
I can't let you break  
  
Cry to me, cry to me  
You better not hide it  
Let it come, let it bleed  
I ain't laughing, reach in and get it  
And set it free  
Cry to me, cry to me  
  
The glass is empty and the wine  
Is bitter on your tongue  
People don't seen wild and fine  
Like when you were young  
  
You're lonesome over a stormy ocean  
Lost in the rain and wind  
We can clear these clouds away  
And feel the sun again

"Stand at the window  
Pull back the lace  
I feel the night wind on my face  
All that I long for - all that I crave  
Am I master, Am I slave?  
The night's so still  
I feel the lovers out in the hills  
The breathing of young girls lying in bed  
Visions of love in their heads  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on  
A beautiful boy gazed in a pool  
His eyes looking back like jewels  
The call of the mirror - too strong to resist  
The call of the water - the call of a kiss  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on  
It wants to be held - possessed  
It wants consummation  
It moves on obsessed  
Bloodstream through pipes  
Singing in the wires  
Heat - motion - control  
Desire walks on  
Stand at the window  
The world is so still  
Calling you back by force of will  
Where did you go?  
I don't know why  
Too much longing inside  
You wrapped me in nighttime sexual disguise  
I was the love in your eyes  
You took me over  
My innocence cracked  
You own my passion  
I want you back  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on

"Wayfaring warrior soul, still wild  
The archer stands  
Arrow measured to the goal, sing of  
Strong and living man  
In his mind there is a vision wand'ring  
Through the forest town  
Telling of riches only given if through  
The woods the way is found  
  
Crying ah! beautiful dancers wake up  
From your sleep!  
Ah gentle romancers, drink of love  
So sweet!  
  
Treasure glowing in their eyes, forest  
Deepens dark their dream  
Keep to the pathway he advise the woods  
Are more than they might seem  
Heed you now the apparition bending never  
Ending sounds  
Call you into her mystery, are your eyes  
Not sparkling now?  
  
Sighing ahh! take you no warning,  
Make no foolish fight  
Ahh, think not of morning, lie here  
Through the night!  
  
Beauty take us! they call in my arms!  
They hear her say  
Silken web falls, mist illusion rips away  
Helpless! helpless! now they scream  
Helpless on the path he stands  
And awakens from his dream singing string  
Beneath his hand  
  
Gentle archer ages old, release the aim  
Free the goal  
Roll your arrow to my soul, release the aim  
Free the goal

Heart's getting stupid, now that is a strange thing  
I got a heartbeat, I feel the heat rise,  
I got no questions, I got no alibis

Sands and mountains are insignificant  
  
Now don't try to tell me love is dead,  
It is your body, now it is your head

I can't stop talking, I can't stop dreaming

"Fast times  
Fast times  
Bell, bell ringing me out of my sleep  
Make the world on time  
Make a little money, little money to keep  
When you see the light turn green  
You better be the first off the line  
You gotta move and move right now  
Or you gonna get left behind  
Fast times  
Fast times  
Same old school bee  
I don't care too much  
About making those grades  
Every day, every single day  
I only come here just to see my babe  
Night shift, cash it out  
Time clock punching me out of the door  
Fire it up come on rev it, rev it up  
Shoot my care into the freeway war  
Fast times  
Fast times  
At the end of one day's race  
I just got to see my darling's face  
Before the day starts in again  
Before the morning rings and rings  
My baby's waiting anxiously  
Pouring kisses over me  
Always makes my nights so warm  
In the loving power of his arms

There was only you and me  
We were young and wild and free  
Now nothing can take you away from me  
  
We've been down that road before  
But that's over now  
You keep me coming back for more

But just hold me now

Through the good times and the bad  
I'll be standing there by you

And I found it there in your heart  
It isn't too hard to see  
We're in heaven

"Heavy heart think of yesterday  
And you're torn apart thinkin' of the ways  
Easier to smile more than today  
Love grew wild  
Heavy heart like a perfect stranger  
And you make it hard  
Takin' all the blame  
Still you hear the sound callin' your name  
Trouble's callin' down so heavy  
Turnin' around  
It's pressin' me down  
Heavy heart  
This time I find  
It weighs on my mind  
Heavy heart  
It's just like you to take it all so far  
Then you feel abused  
And wonder who you are  
Everything you've done  
Anything you start  
Can turn and run  
Ain't it true? It's only just a stage  
Give it room, start an empty page  
Get back in the game, do it your way  
You don't have to play so heavy  
Turnin' around  
It's pressin' me down  
Heavy heart  
This time I find  
It weighs on my mind  
Heavy heart  
When your heart is strong  
It leads you on  
But when it breaks you  
It devastates you for so long  
Turnin' around  
It's pressin' me down  
Heavy heart  
This time I find  
It weighs on my mind  
Heavy heart  
Turnin' around  
It's pressin' me down  
Heavy heart  
This time I find  
It weighs on my mind  
Heavy heart

I took me over and turned me wild  
Only to make it true  
  
But when I'm alone, all alone  
No one home, the TV and the phone  
Still say it will rain today

Hey darlin', darlin', help me to understand  
What went wrong with the peaceful plan  
Was it bold  
  
I ain't wishing for what used to be  
I only hope that you and me  
Can keep hold, unsold  
  
When you got no history, you're free  
You sing and you believe so strong  
You hold out fast and long, so long  
  
Now the latest is the greatest is their plan  
But they didn't make us and they can't break us  
Darlin', darlin', I don't think they can

So perfect in mind Gonna lose this blue addiction of mine Me,

I walk by Christmas windows Full of things I'll never own Things  
  
I cannot give you My fortune's set in stone

How beautiful the falling snow It hushes all the world And heals a melancholy
heart  
How beautiful, how beautiful The candle in the window It dances and it swirls  
How beautiful the snow tonight How beautiful the world How beautiful,
beautiful  
  
Da da da da's For some, the table's laden Others are denied Makes my love run
deeper  
When I see how hard you try And just like you, the snow falls Silent in the
night

"In the quiet afternoon you left and went down into town  
And I just watched the empty road behind you  
Where the fog lies kissing the mountainside  
You want to be sleeping, deep inside  
Believing that the hungry world won't find you  
  
Well, that's just fine, that's just fine  
You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know  
What I believe anymore  
Or whether to leave, or whether to stay  
Or what I can say  
To make you know  
How deep it goes  
  
Somebody turned on the dirty blues  
I know you don't like the blues  
Cause the words are always the same  
And they kind of remind you  
Somebody turned the blues on me  
I don't like the blues cause I can't see  
Through the tears that come and make it hard to find you  
  
Come on down  
Come on down  
You've got to come lay down here and say those things  
Those warm things, right here in my ear  
The times that you had that water like wine  
So clean and so fine to make me know how deep it goes  
Well, that's just fine, that's just fine  
You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know  
If I could leave anymore, even though there's a scar  
Still fresh from the war, don't think about it no more  
Letting new love flow  
How deep it goes

"Baby, I never gave my heart to anyone, oh no  
Used to think that love was a game  
I used to make it just for fun  
When we spent the night together  
Didn't mean it meant that much  
Now I just can't live without your touch  
  
I didn't want to to need you, no  
I didn't want to want you like I do  
I didn't mean to fall  
Didn't want to care at all  
I didn't want to need you  
Like I need you now  
  
I can't get no sleep  
'Cause I keep thinking of you all through the  
Night, oh yeah  
My eyes can't wait to see you again  
My arms can't wait to hold you tight oh yeah  
And when you're laying here beside me  
There is nothing else I need  
Never thought that this could ever be

I didn't want to want you like I do  
I didn't mean to fall  
Didn't want to care at all  
I didn't want to need you  
Like I need you now  
  
I've always been free  
To leave when I want to leave  
But it's not up to me anymore  
I didn't want to need you  
  
I didn't want to to need you, no  
I didn't want to want you like I do  
I didn't mean to fall  
Didn't want to care at all  
I didn't want to need you  
But I need you now

"I know you got a secret that you really don't want to show  
You hid something somebody did to you and you guard it like a lie  
And I know what I'm talking about  
Cause I've seen it leaking out  
But I'm with you baby now, and I'm not sneaking out  
Cause I know and I feel you're not showing me  
How can I change what you won't let me see  
  
[Chorus]  
I give up I give in  
You win this time  
Knowing you means let you go  
I give up I give in  
You win this time  
But don't belong  
Baby don't belong I love you I love you  
  
I know eves droppers might find out more than they might wanna know  
Yeah I know but I feel you're loving me  
How can I change what you won't let me see  
  
[Chorus]

"When the night has come  
And I'm all alone  
And I have some time to breath  
So much damage done  
I guess nobody won  
Is it to late to make you see  
  
I love you  
Oh darling  
Yes I really do  
I love you  
Oh darling  
Yes I really do  
  
I know very well  
How it got this way  
I was drifting on my cloud  
There isn't much to tell  
Except you've gone away  
And darling now I'm reaching out  
  
I love you  
Let me show you  
How I really do  
I love you  
Oh darling  
You gotta know it's true  
  
I wish that I had you now  
The way that I had you then  
Darling, I'd take you and hold you and kiss you  
Over and over again  
Oooh  
  
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh  
Umm umm umm umm umm  
Oooh oooh oooh  
  
Maybe we can try  
To get back to that place  
When passion made us wild  
No more alibis  
Standing face to face  
You will see it in my eyes  
  
I love you - oh my darling  
You should know it's true  
I love you  
Oh let me tell you  
How much I really do  
Oh darling  
You know I really do  
Oh darling  
Yes I really do

"The night is falling like an angel on your memory  
And we are well acquainted  
We are sworn enemies  
And the lonely beating of my heart tonight is only one more thing  
I gotta fight  
  
Well I think about you baby, days of heaven that we had  
Then I get to thinking maybe, maybe too much thinking's bad  
Well, my mind takes no prisoners, pities no one  
Spares not even me till the harm is done  
  
Here I go again  
The night just walked in  
In walks the night  
In walks my fantasy  
Darkness all around me  
And I'm dying for the light  
  
I reach down for a little strength deep inside  
Well I know I love my freedom, but lonely feelings come and go  
And night time is a season  
Feel the cold wind blow  
  
And I toss and I turn and I walk the floor  
I don't want to cry don't want to cry no more  
Here I go again the night just walked in  
In walks the night  
  
In walks my fantasy  
Darkness all around me  
And I'm dying for the light I reach down for a little strength deep inside  
I reach down for my sanity  
If only these eyes could see through all the emptiness I found around me  
In walks the night  
  
I can almost feel you in the darkness all around  
Still I'm waiting for the break of day  
Waiting for a miracle a dream that won't wander away  
Well my mind takes no prisoners pities no one  
It spares not even me till the harm is done  
  
Here I go again  
The night just walked in  
In walks the night  
In walks my fantasy  
Darkness all around me  
And I'm dying for the light  
  
I reach down for a little strength deep inside  
I reach down for my sanity  
If only these eyes would see through all the emptiness I found around me  
  
In walks the night  
The night just walked in  
In walks the night  
The night just walked in  
Maybe I'll be all right  
In walks the night

"It's Christmas Time  
Christmas is the time of year When miracles are done You can give your hand to
a friend in need A smile to a sad someone Your best friend knocks upon your
door And asks if you want to play You don't feel much like sharing your toys
But you share them anyway You make the time to take some time With dear and
special ones Christmas is the time of year When miracles are done Open up your
heart it's Christmas time Illuminate the dark it's Christmas time Shine a
little light into the world It's Christmas time Christmas is the time of year
when music's in the air Timeless and familiar songs You hear them everywhere
Even Ebenezer Scrooge sang on Christmas day Something's living in those songs
That all hearts long to say Open up your heart it's Christmas time Illuminate
the dark it's Christmas time Shine a little light into the world It's
Christmas time

And a thousand days  
The wild bird singing  
Of true love ways  
  
Cryin' out  
From the heart of desire  
Circling over  
Night full of fire  
  
Awake in the kisses  
Oh, awake in the grave  
We've been together  
Far beyond the death  
Stay by my side in darkness, night and day  
  
Stay with me, remain, remain, remain  
Mashalla!  
Mashalla!  
  
Ancient eye  
I leave you behind  
You're not of my body  
You're not of my mind  
  
River, river no one shall remain  
Again and again I call your endless name  
Say to me darkness, night and day  
  
Say to me, remain, remain, remain

Mashalla!

It's a neighborhood war better lock that door  
Flesh and blood and cold concrete  
Baby can't make it. Baby can't make it  
Standing in line at the tabloid shrine in the middle of the public night  
Addict consumers consuming the rumors with a killer, killer appetite  
RAGE!  
Amphetamine vapor on glass in the paper underneath fluorescent night  
In the catacombs of Styrofoam out of mind and out of sight  
Baby can't make it! Baby can't make it!

Where is the heartbeat?  
Not up elite street beating down the little guy  
The madness mounts the judge lost count, lost inside a technical lie!

"We lead two different lives  
Just like two lines that never cross  
And here we are together  
Standing closer than we are  
But we're still standing here untouched  
Too scared to make a move  
We want so much to touch  
And we can't wait forever  
We know it's dangerous  
For us to be together  
  
How do we ever keep this secret  
How do we keep it in the dark  
And if we dare to taste our weakness  
How could we tear ourselves apart  
Why do we keep this love together  
Didn't we know right from the start  
That we would have to keep this secret  
Or forever stay apart  
  
I watch you coming to me  
Walking in the pouring rain  
I can't help looking at you  
Wishing I could stay away  
So many times I've tried in vain  
To close my eyes and pray it goes away  
But I can't stop myself from feeling  
To let you go would be too much  
For me to take  
  
How do we ever keep this secret  
How do we deep it in the dark  
And if we dare to taste our weakness  
How could we tear ourselves apart  
Why do we keep this love together  
Didn't we know right from the start  
That we would have to keep this secret  
Or forever stay apart  
  
I can't help thinking  
When I look into your eyes  
How much I need you  
It's so hard to hide  
  
How do we ever keep this secret  
How do we keep it in the dark  
And if we dare to taste our weakness  
How could we tear ourselves apart  
Why do we keep this love together  
Didn't we know right from the start  
That we would have to keep this secret  
Or be doomed to stay apart

Get down with the moves

In the night I walk alone  
In the night is where I belong  
Take my flesh - I'll give you my soul  
Hungry night keeps driving me on  
Neon concrete jungle  
Devour the weak the humble  
Hear the city nocturne  
Makes you burn  
Oh, slip on into darkness  
Sharpen up your awareness  
Get your seven senses working tonight

"Go to the city away from the land, stand in a line  
Where they stamp your hand, wind up at a dance  
You want to energize, is it just by chance?  
People have electric eyes  
Wires and strings, line that lead to power supplies  
Games read green on table screens, charged and powered  
Mediaized, we are channeled, we are hypnotized  
Wake up, shake up the situation  
Hold on, help the situation  
Human condition, so extreme  
You can see it feeding the new machine  
There is still a dream, our humanity, hero rebels die  
Leaving us the key  
Wake up, shake up the situation  
Hold on, help the situation

Just another wolf at the door

Just smiling tooth and nail

Some things you can't disguise  
Just to look in the hallway mirror  
Now it's howling in your eyes

Slinking through your evils nights

"Spare a little candle  
Save some light for me  
Figures up ahead  
Moving in the trees  
White skin in linen  
Perfume on my wrist  
And the full moon that hangs over  
These dreams in the mist  
  
Darkness on the edge  
Shadows where I stand  
I search for the time  
On a watch with no hands  
I want to see you clearly  
Come closer than this  
But all I remember  
Are the dreams in the mist  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  
  
Is it cloak n dagger  
Could it be spring or fall  
I walk without a cut  
Through a stained glass wall  
Weaker in my eyesight  
The candle in my grip  
And words that have no form  
Are falling from my lips  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  
  
There's something out there  
I can't resist  
I need to hide away from the pain  
There's something out there  
I can't resist  
  
The sweetest song is silence  
That I've ever heard  
Funny how your feet  
In dreams never touch the earth  
In a wood full of princes  
Freedom is a kiss  
But the prince hides his face  
From dreams in the mist  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

It took your smile away

Out under the sky  
  
And it can happen any day  
Everything goes astray  
But the starts do us o.k.  
Let's run away  
  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Out under the sky  
  
It's all right, let it go  
Shake the world off you shoulders  
You have the perfect alibi  
Just because the world is wide  
Out under the sky  
  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Out under the sky  
  
When all is said and done  
Darlin' we are the only ones  
There's only you and I  
Out under the sky  
Out under the sky  
Out under the sky

"Below the bridge the water rose on by  
Trouble's gone and time is on my side  
Been living in my ordinary shoes  
Walkin' off my ordinary blues  
  
Once upon a love so bright and true  
The weather changed, it went to Sunday School  
Once upon a dark and stormy day  
The promises dried up and blew away  
  
I found myself a brand new neighborhood  
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm walkin' good  
Take tomorrow, I'm giving up the past  
Nothing but a hobo walkin' good at last  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home  
Take the high road and down below  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home  
Take the high road and down below  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home  
Take the high road and down below  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home  
Take the high road and down below

"He don't know that you been coming around  
He don't know that we been out of bounds  
Things we do are better left unsaid  
You and me can never keep our heads  
What he don't know  
Will never hurt him  
What he don't know  
Is I have changed  
It's just a matter of time  
Till it all comes down down down  
Till he hears  
The stories going round round round  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
  
Baby, I'm open to your every suggestion  
Nothing you ask is out of the question  
Things I wouldn't do ya got me doin'  
And oh, what I wouldn't do for you  
  
What he don't know  
Will never hurt him  
What he don't know  
Is I have changed  
It's just a matter of time  
Till it all comes down down down  
Till he hears  
The stories going round round round  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
What he don't know

"You're not sure what you want to do  
with your life  
but you sure don't want me in it  
Yeah you're sure the life you're  
living with me  
can't go on one single minute  
And there's a new one waiting  
outside this door  
and now's the time to begin it  
  
You found a new world and  
you want to taste it  
But that world can turn cold and  
you better face it  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground  
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry  
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I  
  
You won't know what it's like to live  
on your own  
You've always had me there beside you  
You think it's easy finding  
someone out there  
who's gonna care as much as I do  
What's gonna happen baby  
when you find out  
that there's no one there to cry to  
  
You can tell the whole world how you're  
gonna make it  
You can follow you heart but what ya do  
when someone breaks it  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground  
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry  
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I  
  
You found a new world and  
you want to taste it  
But that world can turn cold and  
you better face it  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground  
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry  
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Who's gonna pick your world up off the ground  
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry  
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I
